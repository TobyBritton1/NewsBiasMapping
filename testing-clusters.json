making the operation more complex.\nThis is the deadliest incident involving the French military since 1983, when 58 paratroopers were killed in a truck bombing in Lebanon.\nThe troops who died in Monday's tragedy in the Liptako region near Niger were helping French commandos on the ground hunting down a group of extremists.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron expressed his \"deep sadness\" and called the soldiers \"heroes\" who \"had only one goal: protecting us\".\nThe flight data recorders have been found and an investigation is under way.\nThe soldiers were chasing fighters with the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara, which is linked to IS.\nA new surge in extremist attacks in Mali has killed more than 100 local troops in the past two months.\nThe region is an emerging front in the fight against IS and other extremist groups, including those linked to al Qaeda, the US has said.\nBefore his death this year, IS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi congratulated \"brothers\" in Mali and neighbouring Burkina Faso for pledging allegiance.\nThe French operation in West and Central Africa is its largest overseas military mission and involves 4,500 personnel.\nFrance intervened in 2013 after extremists seized control of major towns in northern Mali and implemented a harsh version of Islamic law.\nThey were forced back into the desert, where they have regrouped.\nSince 2013, at least 44 French soldiers have died in the operation.","1":"Former star stock picker Neil Woodford and his business partner took home \u00a313.8m in dividends in the financial year prior to his fund empire's collapse, accounts filed at Companies House reveal.\nThe accounts covering the 12 months to the end of March showed Mr Woodford received \u00a39m thanks to his 65% stake in Woodford Investment Management, while chief executive Craig Newman picked up \u00a34.8m.\nThey had together pocketed \u00a336.5m in the previous year.\nMr Woodford's flagship equity income fund was suspended in June.\nThe figures come at a time when at least 300,000 investors remain trapped in the fund, which is being wound up from 18 January.\nWoodford Investment Management is also being wound up, marking a spectacular fall from grace of a man who was once the UK's most celebrated investment star.\nThe 2018-19 dividend payouts covered a period when investors were leaving in droves, ultimately resulting in the crisis that led the fund's suspension.\nAccounts showed that Woodford Investment Management's pre-tax profit fell by more than half to \u00a318.4m from \u00a341.7m the year before.\nThe filing blamed the \"underperformance in the Woodford equity income fund combined with a period of sustained and negative press coverage\" for the fund's suspension as investors tried to pull cash out.\nThe fund had invested in illiquid assets - meaning they were difficult to sell off quickly.\nThat made it vulnerable when investors were trying to pull out money.\nThe Financial Conduct Authority has since announced that it is looking at new rules to prevent funds invested in illiquid assets from allowing daily withdrawals.","2":"More than \u00a380,000 has been raised to help a British woman found guilty of lying about being gang raped in Cyprus.\nThe GoFundMe page was set up by British lawyer John Hobbs in August to help the 19-year-old raise funds for legal representation.\nThe young woman had said she was raped by up to 12 Israeli tourists in a hotel room in the town of Ayia Napa on 17 July.\nBut she was charged after she signed a retraction statement 10 days after the incident.\nIn court, she claimed Cypriot police pressured her to change her account of what happened but she was convicted of public mischief.\nThe men arrested at the time, who were aged between 15 and 20, were freed.\nShe is going to appeal against the ruling.\nThe girl's mother has said she supports calls for a tourist boycott of the country after the hashtag #BoycottCyprus started circulating on Twitter.\nShe told the BBC's Today programme: \"The place isn't safe - it is absolutely not safe.\n\"And if you go and report something that's happened to you, you're either laughed at, as far as I can tell, or, in the worst case, something like what's happened to my daughter may happen.\"\nThe Foreign Office has said it has raised concerns at an \"official level\" with the authorities in Cyprus, after previously saying it was \"seriously concerned about the fair trial guarantees\" involved in the case.\nLawyers and campaigners have also spoken out about the case and criticised the Cypriot justice system after Monday's conviction.\nThe teenager had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, and the doctor who made the diagnosis argued that the trial did not take that into consideration.\nDr Christine Tizzard told The Guardian: \"Aside the fact it hasn't been fully represented, it means she's been unable to get the treatment she so sorely needs and every day she's not having treatment the worse it gets.\"\nThe Cypriot government has been defending itself, saying: \"The Republic of Cyprus as an orderly state has constitutionally established institutions and separation of powers.\n\"In this context, the government does not intervene in cases brought before the competent courts of the Republic of Cyprus, nor does it comment on positions or allegations which are raised with respect to cases still pending before the courts.\n\"The government has full confidence in the justice system and the courts of the Republic of Cyprus, which should be left unfettered to implement state laws and deliver justice.\"\nJudge Michalis Papathanasiou said he believed the woman had made false allegations because she felt \"embarrassed\" after realising she had been filmed having sex in a video found on some of the Israelis' mobile phones.\n\"There was no rape, or violence, and police had carried out a thorough investigation making all necessary arrests.\"\nThe woman could face up to a year in jail and a 1,700 euro (\u00a31,500) fine when she is sentenced on 7 January.","3":"Seventeen people have been arrested on suspicion of being involved with an international human trafficking group, as almost 30 women were led to safety.\nThose arrested are between 17 and 50 years of age and include 14 men and three women, the Metropolitan Police said.\nAll are in custody at a central London police station.\nScotland Yard raided properties in Redbridge, Havering, Barking and Dagenham, Newham, Brentwood and Tower Hamlets in the early hours of Thursday.\nThose held were arrested suspicion of modern slavery, controlling prostitution, Class A drug offences and section five firearm offences, relating to a stungun.\nAn additional four warrants were executed simultaneously in Romania, with one man being attested in Constanta, in the south east of the country.\nA total of 29 women, aged from 20 to 40, were led from the addresses and taken to a safe place.\nA number of charities and organisations including the Church of England and Refuge supported the operation, which was in the latter stages of an international operation called Operation Kelang.\n\"Today's synchronised operational activity spanned 16 addresses in east London and four addresses in Romania with the aim of, in one fell swoop, dismantling an organised crime network and providing support to the victims,\" said Detective Chief Inspector Richard McDonagh.","4":"At least 20 people have been hurt in a \"serious\" crash in Cambridgeshire between a minibus and a car, emergency services have said.\nMore than 20 firefighters were at the scene, along with ambulances and police.\nIn a statement, Cambridgeshire Police said: \"Multiple people are involved and some are seriously injured.\n\"The roads going in either direction at the junction have been closed and motorists are advised to avoid the area.\"\nCasualties are being taken to Addenbrooke's and Hinchingbrooke hospitals, a spokesperson for the East of England Ambulance Service said.\nPolice have said the crash happened on the B1040 Somersham Road at the junction with Bluntisham Heath Road.\nIt was first reported to emergency services at 4.51pm.\nBoth roads have been closed and drivers are being told to avoid the area.\nCambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust has tweeted to say it is \"supporting a major incident\".\nThe hospital has urged potential patients to call 111 for advice unless they require urgent or emergency care.\n:: Anyone who witnessed the collision is asked to contact the road policing unit on 101 or visit www.cambs.police.uk\/report.","5":"Virgin Money, Lloyds Banking Group and Direct Line have announced job cuts totalling more than 2,000 on a bleak day for financial services workers.\nThe three companies all partly blamed ongoing changes to customer behaviour for the cuts - including the fact that many bank customers choose to go online rather than visit branches.\nDirect Line is slashing around 7% of its workforce with 800 jobs going, while Lloyds is cutting 780 roles and Virgin Money will lose 500.\nIn a statement published on Wednesday afternoon, Virgin Money - which is based in Norwich - said the move was partly the result of a shift to online banking and also part of ongoing changes following its merger with Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank.\nThe bank had already warned that the \u00a31.7bn tie-up in 2018 would put 1,500 jobs at risk of redundancy.\nLast September it confirmed 330 jobs would be cut in the first tranche of the losses.\nOn Wednesday, Virgin Money said a total of 22 of its branches will close between May and September this year, reducing its number of nationwide sites to 166.\nLucy Dimes, group business transformation officer at Virgin Money UK, said: \"The decision to close branches is never taken lightly.\"\nShe said the changes were focused in areas where the merged group had more than one branch in the same areas as well as reflecting \"changes to customer demand\".\nMeanwhile Direct Line's decision to wield the axe is due to plans to streamline its operations across Britain, with an aim to appeal more to its customers.\nIt follows chief executive Penny James' comments to investors in November that Direct Line would seek to remove \u00a360m of costs from the business.\nLloyds echoed the issues that Virgin and Direct Line were facing, with a spokesperson telling Sky News customers were using the bank's branches \"less often\".\nBut trade union Unite criticised its decision to reduce its workforce and accused Lloyds of having a \"profits over people culture\".\nIt was also a tough day for Metro Bank, which announced it was scaling back its branch expansion programme by half after a troubled year when it was hit by a \u00a3900m accounting mistake.\nThe lender also reported a pre-tax loss of \u00a3130.8m for 2019.\nThere was further misery away from the financial sector as clothing retailer Ted Baker announced 160 job losses and Frankie and Benny's owner The Restaurant Group (TRG) said it was shutting up to 90 branches by the end of next year.\nIt comes a day after supermarket giant Tesco said it plans to cut 1,800 jobs from its in-store bakeries in a shake-up blamed on a drop in demand for loaves of bread.","6":"This year has been one of the hottest on record, the World Meteorological Organisation has said.\nThe UN body says the planet has seen a decade of \"exceptional\" heat -

national charity.\nAction for Children says many youngsters live in areas where there is little or no support available to help them cope with the effects.\nAnna (not her real name) who lived with an abusive partner for several years and now volunteers with Action for Children told Sky News she is worried about how the abuse has affected her young children.\n\"They still talk now about hammers

money to provide children's support services, wants the next government to re-introduce a domestic violence bill to give victims more help and protection.\nSally Noden, a children's service manager for Action for Children in Newcastle, said: \"We want to see that children are in the legislation as victims, we want a statutory duty for councils to provide specialist services for children.\"\nAnalysis by the charity of government statistics for 2018\/19 shows an average of 692 children a day in England are assessed by children's social care services as being affected by domestic violence.\nMeanwhile, research conducted earlier this year by Stirling University into specialist support services for those children across 30 councils in England and Wales showed limited help is available.\nMore than one in 10 of the councils provided no service, while more than a third reported a postcode lottery for children's support and two thirds said their service provision was at risk due to limited funding.\nIf a domestic violence bill in the Queen's Speech last month had been passed into law it would have forced councils to provide help for children exposed to abusive relationships.\nAction for Children insists a similar bill must be brought back to parliament and backed up with government funding.\nSally Noden said: \"We need to have a commitment, we need to have

private sector employers, is to take back day-to-day management control of the company's core poultry operation in an effort to stem losses.\nIn an internal memo circulated this week, Mr Boparan and Ronald Kers, Boparan Holdings' president and group chief executive respectively, informed employees that Andrew McInnes, UK poultry managing director for just a year, was leaving the company.\nThe division's commercial director, Dan Howell, is also departing.\nSources said on Friday that the changes had been instigated by Mr Boparan amid mounting frustration over the performance of the poultry business, which supplies the UK's biggest supermarket chains.\nThe shake-up of senior leadership comes two years after 2SFG was hit by a food hygiene scandal in 2017, when a Guardian and ITV undercover investigation revealed a host of failures to adhere to industry standards.\nThe crisis triggered an appearance by Mr Boparan in front of a parliamentary select committee, with MPs reporting that the company's \"past record\u2026[was] far from pristine\".\nMr Boparan's move to seize the reins of the poultry business on a caretaker basis leaves him in the bizarre position of reporting to Mr Kers in his capacity as group CEO, who is then accountable to Mr Boparan as the company's controlling shareholder.\nFood industry sources pointed to growing tensions between Mr Boparan and Mr Kers, who was recruited over a year ago from Muller, the dairy products group.\nMr Kers is understood to have parachuted in a number of former Muller colleagues on lucrative contracts, which is said to have created unease among existing 2SFG executives.\nBoparan Holdings, which has \u00a3630m of debt repayable in 2021 in the form of high-interest bonds, has been steadily selling assets in an effort to reduce its debt pile.\nIt has already offloaded businesses including Goodfellas, the pizza brand, and more recently Matthew Walker, the UK's biggest supplier of Christmas puddings.\nSky News understands that the company is now preparing to kick off a formal auction of Fox's Biscuits, one of the best-known players in the sector, in the new year.\nBankers at Rothschild are handling that process.\nOther disposals will follow, although 2SFG's substantial ready-meals operation is unlikely to be put on the block.\nIn total, Boparan Holdings employs about 18,000 people, with more than 15,000 of those based at various manufacturing sites across the UK.\nAn industry insider said that when the non-core disposals had been completed, it was likely to raise questions about the future of Mr Kers's role.\n\"Ranjit has essentially lost patience and taken back control.\n\"When your key poultry team doesn't deliver, it was obvious a keep-it-simple guy like him wouldn't tolerate it, especially with their poor cash position and debt pile.\n\"So he's back doing what he loves, running the main division day-to-day.\nThe source added that there \"must be a big question mark about Kers' long-term future now\".\n\"The way these changes were made and what they symbolise fundamentally undermines his [Mr Kers'] authority.\"\n\"2SFG's poultry division accounts for roughly \u00a31.5bn in annual revenues - or about 60% of the group total.\nMr Boparan, who left school aged 16 and founded 2SFG in 1993 as a supplier of own-label chicken to Tesco, is expected to announce quarterly results to bondholders next week.\nA spokesman for Boparan Holdings said: \"The business has posted very encouraging financial results and this is set to continue as we realise our turnaround plan.\"\n\"However, in order to accelerate this plan our senior leaders have decided to take a more hands-on approach.\n\"Ranjit and Ronald have one clear goal in mind, which is to continue to deliver improved results for the business.\n\"Already our changes have seen improved performance and we look forward to delivering our transformation plan for all stakeholders.\"","16":"Harvey Weinstein was once one of Hollywood's most powerful men.\nNow, the 67-year-old disgraced film producer is facing up to 29 years in prison after being found guilty sexual assault and rape.\nThe verdict is being hailed as a watershed moment in the #MeToo movement.\nHere are some reactions to his conviction.\nRose McGowan\nOne of the first women to accuse Weinstein, Rose McGowan tweeted that it was \"a powerful day & a huge step forward in our collective healing\".\nMargot Robbie\nThe Once Upon A Time\u2026 In Hollywood actress posted a cartoon version of Weinstein on Instagram, with the word \"guilty\" written above his head.\nQuoting a #MeToo statement, she wrote: \"Today's guilty verdicts in the Weinstein trial are a testament to the bravery and resilience of the #SilenceBreakers, and a victory for survivors everywhere.\n\"This is just the beginning.

But I also think that I'm hoping, I'm hoping that the women who were victimised feel some comfort from such justice.\"\nMira Sorvino\nThe Oscar-winning actress, who has said Weinstein harassed her in a hotel room, wrote on Twitter: \"I am so proud to stand in the company of my fellow Silence Breakers on this historic day.\"\nRoseanna Arquette\nArquette, who has said she resisted unwanted sexual advances by Weinstein, tweeted: \"Gratitude to the brave women who've testified and to the jury for seeing through the dirty tactics of the defence.\n\"We will change the laws in the future so that rape victims are heard and not discredited and so that it's easier for people to report their rapes.\"\nShe also posted a shot of NBC news which showed an image of Weinstein and the headline \"Harvey Weinstein found guilty in New York sexual assault trial\".\nDaryl Hannah\nThe Splash star, who said she repeatedly turned down advances from Weinstein, wrote on Twitter: \"For decades Harvey Weinstein used his power and position to harass, assault and rape women.\n\"Now a verdict, from a jury of seven men and five women have held him partially accountable.\n\"Harvey Weinstein is a convicted sex offender.\"\nHeather Graham\nThe Boogie Nights star, who has said she was once propositioned by Weinstein, posted a statement from Tina Tchen, president and chief executive of the Time's Up Foundation on Instagram.\nIt read: \"This trial - and the jury's decision today - marks a new era of justice, not just for the Silence Breaker, who spoke out at great personal risk, but for all survivors of harassment, abuse, and assault at work.\"\nAshley Judd\nOne of the first women to publicly accuse Weinstein of sexual misconduct, Judd wrote on Twitter: \"For the women who testified in this case, and walked through traumatic hell, you did a public service to girls and women everywhere, thank you.\"\nShe signed off with the hashtags #ConvictWeinstein and #Guilty.\nMyleene Klass\nThe British musician, who says she was once propositioned by the movie mogul, tweeted: \"Harvey Weinstein found guilty.\"\nShe followed it with the clapping emoji.\nLea Seydoux\nThe No Time To Die star, who said Weinstein once tried to persuade her to come up to his hotel room, shared a Time's Up post on Instagram.\nThe only post on her page, it reads: \"Time's Up on silence. Time's Up on waiting. Time's Up on tolerating discrimination, harassment and abuse #TimesUP.\"\nRosie Perez\nPerez testified at Weinstein's trial to bolster the account of friend and fellow actress Annabella Sciorra.\nShe shared the message: \"Harvey Weinstein has been handcuffed & taken to jail!\"\n:: Listen to the Daily podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker\nRonan Farrow\nThe New Yorker journalist, who broke stories about allegations against Weinstein, paid tribute to the women who shared their story.\nFarrow wrote on Twitter: \"Today's outcome in Harvey Weinstein's New York trial is the result of the decisions of multiple women to come forward to journalists and to prosecutors at great personal cost and risk.\n\"Please keep those women in your thoughts today.\"\nBill Cosby's publicist\nMeanwhile, Bill Cosby's publicist issued a statement on social media calling Weinstein's verdict \"a very sad day\" and asking where \"wealthy and famous men can find fairness\".\nIn a lengthy post, Andrew Wyatt wrote: \"This is not shocking because these jurors were not sequestered, which gave them access to media coverage and the sentiments of public opinion.\n\"There's no way you would have anyone believe that Mr Weinstein was going to receive a fair and impartial trial. Also, this judge showed that he wanted a conviction by sending the jurors back to deliberate, after they were hung on many of the counts.\n\"Here's the question that should haunt all Americans, especially wealthy and famous men... Where do we go in this country to find fairness and impartiality in the judicial system; and where do we go in this country to find Due Process?\n\"Lastly, if the #metoo movement isn't just about Becky [White women], I would challenge #metoo and ask them to go back 400+ years and tarnish the names of those oppressors that raped slaves. This is a very sad day in the American Judicial System.\"","17":"Five teenagers were among hundreds of women who had at least their sixth abortion in Britain last year, Sky News has learnt.\nData for England, Wales and Scotland also shows more than 140 women had at least their eighth termination in 2018 - an increase of more than a quarter over the previous two years.\nAnti-abortion campaigners said the figures were \"extremely alarming\" and suggested that recent law changes allowing early abortion pills to be taken at home had contributed to an increase in repeat terminations.\nData released by the Department of Health for England and Wales and NHS Scotland under the Freedom of Information Act revealed:\nThe Society for the Protection of Unborn Children said women having high numbers of abortions were \"crying out for help\" and voiced concerns about the \"harmful policy\" that allows women in Britain to take an early abortion pill at home.\nAntonia Tully, the organisation's director of campaigns, told Sky News: \"A woman seeking her seventh or eighth abortion could easily be in an abusive situation where she is being repeatedly coerced into having an abortion.\n\"Alarm bells should be ringing loudly when teenage girls are having repeat abortions. Is anyone asking questions about why a teenager, possibly underage, keeps presenting for abortion?\n\"This is a massive betrayal of vulnerable women and girls who need help not abortions.\"\nMs Tully added that women in Britain can have abortions at home \"away from any medical supervision\", saying: \"This harmful policy ignores the evidence that women aborting at home, often alone, can be left with serious mental health problems.\"\nHowever, abortion provider Marie Stopes UK said the number of women having eight or more terminations was a \"tiny fraction\" of the 205,295 abortions carried out in England and Wales last year.\nDr Caroline Gazet, clinical director at Marie Stopes UK, told Sky News: \"For the few women who do need [eight or more abortions], we need to focus on where they are being failed and how we can help them rather than stigmatising their choice.\n\"We have also found that some women seeking more than one abortion, were in violent or controlling relationships, which contributed to their decision to end a pregnancy.\n\"There is no right number of abortions and the reasons women choose to have them are deeply personal and vary widely.\"\n:: Listen to the Daily podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker\nAnti-abortion charity Life said the figures were \"extremely alarming but hardly surprising given the increasingly easy access to abortion\".\nThe charity's director of advocacy Liz Parsons told Sky News: \"Women having repeat abortions, especially young people, would suggest there are underlying problems leading to unplanned pregnancies which are not resolved by putting women on the abortion conveyor belt.\"\nThe figures do not include Northern Ireland where abortion was only decriminalised last month.\nBefore then, abortion was only allowed in Northern Ireland if a woman's life was at risk or there was a danger of permanent and serious damage to her physical or mental health.\nA Scottish government spokesman said: \"We believe all women in Scotland should have access to clinically safe and legal abortion services.\n\"It is our view that abortion care should be part of standard healthcare provisions, free from stigma.\n\"NHS Boards always speak to patients having a termination about contraception options.\"\nA Department of Health spokeswoman said it was unable to comment \"given the pre-election period\".","18":"The wife of the former IS leader who died during a raid on his compound last month has been captured by Turkey, the country's president has announced.\nIt comes after US President Donald Trump announced last month that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had killed himself during a raid on his compound in north-west Syria during an operation by his country's special forces.\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan made the announcement that Turkey had captured the former IS leader's wife in a speech at Ankara University.\nAt the same time he criticised the US decision to announce al-Baghdadi's death, saying: \"The United States said Baghdadi killed himself in a tunnel.\n\"They started a communication campaign about this.\n\"But, I am announcing it here for the first time: we captured his wife and didn't make a fuss like them. Similarly,we also captured his sister and brother-in-law in Syria.\"\nMr Erdogan gave no other details during his announcement.\nTurkish officials had already revealed that the country had captured al-Baghdadi's sister, identified as Rasmiya Awad, and her husband.\nBoth are said to be under investigation over their part in the terror group, however it is not known to what extent they were actually involved.\nIt is reported they were found in the town of Azaz in Aleppo province, an area now under Turkish control, living in the back of a truck.\nTurkish officials described their capture as an intelligence \"gold mine\".\nIt is not clear whether the capture of Awad led to the detention of al-Baghdadi's wife.\nAn aide of al-Baghdadi said that the late-terror leader had four wives - the maximum allowed at any one time according to Islamic law.\nNot much is known about the terror leader's relationships, but one of his wives has been revealed to be an Iraqi called Nour, who is the daughter of one of his aides and was identified by name by al-Baghdadi's brother-in-law in a recent TV interview with al-Arabiya.\nAn ex-wife of his was arrested in Lebanon in 2014, but released a year later in a prisoner swap with al Qaeda, while another fled from the former-IS leader in 2009 during her pregnancy with his daughter.\nAl-Baghdadi's death is a major blow to the terror group, which has lost territory in Syria and Iraq in a series of US-led attacks.\nThe terror group has since named a successor to al-Baghdadi, Abu Ibrahim al Hashemi al Quraishi, but not much is known about him.","19":"Six people have died and another 19 have been injured after a crash between a bus and a truck in Abu Dhabi.\nThe crash happened on Al Raha Beach Road on the way to Dubai, and police said it was caused by \"reckless and irresponsible driving\".\nVideo footage from Abu Dhabi's many CCTV cameras shows \"reckless driving\" of a car which was in front of the truck. The truck driver stopped to avoid crashing into the car.\nHowever a passenger bus then crashed into the truck.\nThe accident happened at about 6.30am and police said the road was reopened by about 8.55am.\nMajor Abdullah Khamis Al-Azizi, head of investigations at the traffic department, said the main causes of the crash were \"excessive speed and the bus driver's failure to observe the road conditions which led to the accident\" according to a statement.\nAmbulances were sent to the scene of the dawn crash and treated some people there, while others were taken to hospital.\nKrishna Prasad Dhakal, Nepalese ambassador to the UAE, told Gulf News that 16 Nepalese expats were among the injured.\nThe ambassador is working to establish if any of them were killed.\nThe accident came just a day after the announcement of new tailgating rules, which mean anyone caught too close to the car in front of them will be fined and given points on their licence.\nCars will be monitored by smart sensors which came into use on 15 January.","20":"Jeremy Corbyn has made Labour a \"welcoming refuge\" for antisemitism and the party is \"no longer a safe space for Jewish people\", a dossier submitted to the human rights watchdog warns.\nThe Jewish Labour Movement (JLM) document, which was leaked on Friday, reveals sworn statements from 70 present and former Labour staffers which will be given to the Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) inquiry into antisemitism in the party.\nLabour is only the second ever political party to have been probed by the EHRC, after the British National Party (BNP).\nCompiled over 13 months up until November, the 53-page dossier concludes the Labour Party is \"no longer a safe space for Jewish people\", with a \"relentless flow\" of antisemitic incidents.\nThe personal accounts of antisemitism in the JLM dossier include:\nThe dossier claims there is a culture of antisemitism in the party which top party officials are \"ignoring, denying, relativising and accepting\".\nMr Corbyn is personally accused of \"publicly supporting antisemites and antisemitic tropes\" under a party \"cast in his image\" that is now \"institutionally antisemitic\".\nThe Labour leader responded to the dossier by insisting he did not interfere with cases and there were only a \"small number\" that were \"in-train\".\n\"I deeply regret there is any antisemitism in our society,\" he added. \"Obviously I regret the way in which some people have been hurt by it and I do not want that to be the case.\"\nThe Labour Party added claims anyone had been instructed to lie were \"categorically untrue\" and that the number of outstanding cases, reported by JLM as 136, was \"not accurate\".\nJLM, which has been affiliated with the Labour Party for 99 years, said testimony it had compiled led it to believe that Labour had \"made the political calculation that antisemitism is a price worth paying to maintain its internal party unity\".\nIt said there are \"no credible figures\" for how many complaints are waiting to be dealt with.\n:: Listen to Campaign Unwrapped on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, Spreaker\nAt a press conference held by JLM and its lawyers on Friday, whistleblower Sam Matthews, who was head of disputes at Labour, said the \"intolerable\" problem of antisemitism within the party had left him considering taking his own life.\nLord Falconer of Thoroton, a former Labour justice secretary, said he has \"the gravest concerns\" about Mr Corbyn's leadership after the \"utterly damning\" dossier.\nHe told The Times: \"It's a leadership issue which the leadership should have dealt with.\n\"I believe it to be utterly damning of the Labour Party. It shows strong evidence of an institutional attempt to sweep under the carpet evidence of antisemitism.\"","21":"An \"amazingly well-preserved\" 18,000-year-old puppy has been found in Siberia - but scientists cannot decide whether it is a dog or a wolf.\nNow named Dogor, a local word for friend, it was found near Yakutsk in eastern Siberia last summer.\nThe male's nose, teeth and fur are in remarkable condition.\nIt is \"possibly the oldest dog ever found\", researcher Love Dalen said, adding that it was \"amazingly well-preserved even before they cleaned it up\".\nIt feels like a \"very recently dead animal\", he said.\nThe body's age was measured by carbon dating its rib bone, but DNA tests have not confirmed its lineage.\nDavid Stanton, a researcher at the Centre for Palaeogenetics in Sweden, said it was \"normally relatively easy\" to tell the difference between a dog and a wolf.\n\"We have a lot of data from it already, and with that amount of data, you'd expect to tell if it was one or the other,\" he told CNN.\n\"The fact that we can't might suggest that it's from a population that was ancestral to both dogs and wolves.\"\nIt is suspected that Dogor is from a time when dogs became domesticated, leading Mr Stanton to suggest he may be \"halfway between\" dogs and wolves.\nThat would chime with research published in the journal Nature Communications in 2017, which said dog domestication appeared to happen between 20,000 and 40,000 years ago.\nThe year before, an Oxford University study, published in the journal Science, said dogs had been domesticated twice, in Europe and Asia.","22":"In its latest effort to stop the spread of the coronavirus the Italian government has placed temporary restrictions on visiting relatives in nursing homes and is urging elderly people not to go outside unless absolutely necessary.\nThe move comes on the day schools and universities across the nation were closed and people were warned to avoid mixing with crowds and keep physical contact to a minimum.\nIn the capital Rome, chemist shops have run out of hand sanitiser and face masks and some pharmacists are resorting to DIY techniques to restock supplies.\nWe found Giulia Papello making her own sanitiser in a small lab at the back of her pharmacy and pouring the alcohol mix into small bottles for sale.\nShe told us there is no alternative. They can't get stock from their usual suppliers and, as the virus has spread, demand is growing by the day.\n\"It is very difficult to find masks even for us, difficult to find alcohol for us,\" she said. \"They all ran out of stock.\"\n\"Do you think you need to wear a mask?\" I ask her.\n\"No, but you don't know how it's going to evolve,\" she says. \"I am optimistic though with all these latest measures.\"\nClose to the pharmacy we find a group of students on the street outside where they should have been attending classes.\nTheir university, like every other across the nation, is shut.\nNine million school pupils are also starting an unexpected break until at least the middle of March.\n\"It's crazy,\" student Eliza Pelagalli tells us.\n\"We are upset because of the stopping of lessons.\n\"Some guys who have their graduation in this period have to do this by internet working and they have a lot to do. And we don't know what to do.\n\"To stop the lessons for us is like to stop the life.\"\nBut there is plenty of support too for what may seem like draconian measures by the government.\nAt a nearby school we meet Christina Verdone whose 15-year-old daughter is a pupil there.\nShe tells us: \"That is the right decision. But not now.\n\"I think they should have done it months ago. Early January for sure.\"\nShe reflects on how things might have been different had the government acted sooner, but she and many others feel more confident now that the restrictions are in place.\nAlong with school closures and curbs on visits to the elderly, major sporting events have been affected.\nEngland's final Six Nations rugby match against Italy, scheduled to take place in Rome next week, has been postponed.\nAnd the man advising the Italian government on the virus tells us the measures are necessary.\nWhen we meet Prof Walter Ricciardi he doesn't offer me his hand to say hello.\nHe tells me: \"We are Italians, we like to shake hands. We we like to kiss. But we should avoid it.\"\nProfessor Ricciardi added: \"It is dramatic actually, the things that we are advising.\n\"And based on evidence and the closing of schools, there is actually limited evidence that these measures are effective. But to contain, we still believe that this is appropriate to do it now.\"\nThe moves may help halt the spread of coronavirus in Italy - the worst affected country in Europe - but they have come too late to stop many visitors cancelling their trips.\nAsk in pretty much any hotel in Rome and they will tell you bookings are down.\nOne tour operator told us they've had thousands of cancellations in the last few days alone.\nAnd that is a huge worry for people in a city which relies heavily on tourism and where street performer Danilo Muscara relies on those visitors to earn a living.\nWe talk to him as he tap dances on a side street telling us the money in the hat by his feet isn't as full as he'd like it to be.\n\"Are you worried?\" I ask. He responds with a smile. \"The situation won't change if you worry or don't worry. I don't worry\"\nBut plenty of people here in Rome and right across Italy do worry. Not just about the virus but the effect it could have on jobs, tourism and the economy.","23":"A father has delighted social media users by sharing a clip of the moment he turns on his severely deaf daughter's hearing aids.\nPaul Addison's four-month-old baby Georgina can be seen waving her arms and smiling in the Twitter video.\nMr Addison, 32, from Harrogate, North Yorkshire, tweeted the clip with the caption: \"When our daughter's new hearing aids are turned on in the morning.\"\nBaby Georgina was diagnosed as severely deaf in September, and wears a hearing aid in each ear to amplify sound.\nMr Addison decided to share the \"lightbulb moment\" with the world after she had been wearing the aids for a few weeks.\nHe told Sky News: \"When I found that she had hearing problems I just switched into practical mode and optimistic mode.\n\"I just had to find out what could be done about it.\n\"Thankfully the hearing aids were provided by the NHS.\"\nMr Addison added: \"They have improved her hearing greatly and we are overjoyed about that, but it is the start of a long road.\n\"She will have to have more tests on her hearing in future.\"\nMr Addison described his daughter's reaction as \"chirpy and cheery\" and said the moment is particularly emotional for him as he cannot hear with his left ear.\nHe continued: \"When we turn her hearing aids on each morning it is absolutely delightful, really wonderful.\n\"She's more happy, more alert, and she can hear her mother's voice.\n\"I'm so just so happy that the clip has been enjoyed so many people across the world.\"\nThe video, which was posted on Twitter on Thursday afternoon, has already been liked thousands of times.\nIt was also watched 150,000 times in under 24 hours.\nIrish actor Chris O'Dowd was among the people to respond to Mr Addison's video when he posted a heart emoji.\nThe National Deaf Children's Society tweeted \"What an amazing expression?!\"\nTwitter user Sister Haile wrote: \"The most beautiful thing I have seen for a long time.\"\nMr Addison said: \"There's a lot to be said about using tools like Twitter for spreading good news and a bit of happiness.\n\"It's quite heartwarming.\"","24":"A judge has rejected Aerosmith drummer Joey Kramer's legal bid to rejoin the band when they perform at the Grammys this weekend.\nThe 69-year-old, who helped found the group 50 years ago, suffered an ankle injury last year which kept him out of action and meant he missed a large part of the band's residency at a Las Vegas casino.\nHe sued the American rockers, arguing breach of contract, after he was told to re-audition for his place and prove he could play \"at an appropriate level\", and apparently failed.\nAerosmith said they had invited Kramer to join them at the music awards, but there was not enough time to rehearse together for him to play on stage.\nKramer argued the \"artificial, made-up and undefined\" requirement was \"insulting and upsetting\" because no other band member had been asked to do it before.\nHe said singer Steven Tyler, guitarists Joe Perry and Bradley Whitford, and bassist Tom Hamilton had all recently been sidelined with injuries and illnesses and had not been asked to re-audition for their jobs.\n\"This is not about money,\" he said in a statement ahead of Wednesday's court hearing in Plymouth, Massachusetts.\n\"I am being deprived of the opportunity to be recognised along with my peers, for our collective, lifetime contributions to the music industry.\"\nBut Massachusetts Superior Court Judge Mark Gildea denied Kramer's legal challenge to be reinstated as Aerosmith's performing drummer.\n\"Given that Kramer has not played with the band in six months and the dearth of available rehearsal time before the upcoming performances, Kramer has not shown a realistic alternative course of action sufficient to protect the band's business interests,\" the ruling stated.\nKramer said he was \"extremely disappointed\" in a statement afterwards.\n\"I knew filing a lawsuit was a bit of an uphill battle,\" he said. \"I can hold my head high knowing that I did the right thing - to fight for my right to celebrate the band's success that I have dedicated the better part of my life to helping build.\"\nAerosmith did not comment on the ruling, but had said in a previous statement: \"Joey Kramer is our brother; his well-being is of paramount importance to us.\n\"However he has not been emotionally and physically able to perform with the band, by his own admission, for the last six months.\n\"We have missed him and have encouraged him to rejoin us to play many times but apparently he has not felt ready to do so.\n\"Joey has now waited until the last moment to accept our invitation, when we unfortunately have no time for necessary rehearsals during Grammys week.\"\nThe four-time Grammy winners are due to perform a career-spanning medley at the show with a replacement drummer.\nThe band are being honoured with the 2020 MusiCares Person of the Year award for their achievements in the music industry, to be presented at a separate ceremony on Friday ahead of the Grammys.\nMusiCares is the charity arm of The Recording Academy, which distributes the Grammy Awards.\nAlice Cooper, Foo Fighters, Jonas Brothers, John Legend and John Mayer are among the artists set to be performing at the Grammys.","25":"Al Pacino leans in conspiratorially as he sits in front of me, and starts to tell a story.\n\"I don't mean to go on here...\" he says. Of course, when Al Pacino is sitting in front of you - dark hair slightly wild, hands gesticulating as he gets into his stride, that much-imitated voice - you're happy for him to go on forever.\nThis comes towards the end of the interview and publicists, hurried for time, are trying to wrap things up. However, the star, seemingly unconcerned by the constraints of a jam-packed schedule that no doubt has to be organised down to the second when looking after one of the most famous actors in the world, commands the room without appearing to realise.\n\"It's very interesting\u2026\" he assures. I'm not going to stop him.\nWe're here to talk about his new TV series, Amazon Prime Video's Hunters, the Hollywood legend's first big foray into the world of binge TV, at the age of 79.\nSet in New York City, 1977, the show focuses on a group of Nazi hunters who discover hundreds of high-ranking Nazi officials are living among us, conspiring to create a Fourth Reich in the US.\nIt's quite a premise.\nPacino, who plays the group's leader, Meyer Offerman, is sitting alongside his young co-star, Logan Lerman, whose character Jonah is recruited following his grandmother's murder.\n\"I thought, this is unusual and interesting, and I'd like to know more about it,\" he says of his initial script reading. \"I was kind of stuck with the character, I kinda thought, there's something here. Sometimes you find the inner voice for something, and I found that.\"\n:: Listen to the Backstage podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker\nInteresting is right. Having seen the first episode, which shows how Jonah discovers the superhero-like Hunters, it's probably not a stretch to say it's going to divide opinions. The subject matter is obviously serious, and it is taken seriously, but there is also a lot of comedic relief and a comic book, sometimes Tarantino-esque style.\nNo spoilers here, but the opening scene is bold and shocking, and gives an idea of how dark the series might get.\nPacino says after reading the script he immediately wanted to meet the show's creator, David Weil, who came up with the idea based on stories told by his grandmother, a Holocaust survivor. (She would have been proud, Weil tells me earlier in the day. And also \"like, 'you have Al Pacino in your show?! What the f***?!'\" It's clear everyone working on the series is excited to have The Godfather star on board.)\n\"We talked,\" says Pacino. \"I got a sense of how it was projecting out, what he was trying to say.\n\"Like always, you take a chance. Because of the way he was, the way he writes, I thought it was worth taking the chance because I think that this kid is going to really come through.\"\nLerman, 28, is best known for films including 2012's The Perks Of Being A Wallflower and The Percy Jackson series. But starring opposite Pacino, who needs no introduction, will surely be his biggest role to date.\nClearly, he was able to learn a lot from his veteran co-star, one of the greatest of all-time. But what did Pacino learn from the younger actors on set?\n\"Well, I learned from him all the time,\" he says, looking over affectionately at Lerman. \"You know, this is a young guy who knows what's going on. Like, he makes sure that I don't fall, and he makes sure that I have my breakfast in the morning.\"\nPacino laughs. \"He's great. And, uh, you're learning all the time.\"\n\"I'm always looking after you, I just love this guy,\" says Lerman. \"I would say more than anything, we both like to work hard. We both like to rehearse and to find as much time as possible to fully realise what we're doing.\"\nTurning to his older co-star, he continues. \"You're a hero to me, you're someone that I love and respect. And I know... every time, I know, I say this in front of you, probably, it makes you cringe...\"\nPacino interrupts. \"I hope I'm blushing, because if I'm not blushing I gotta problem.\"\nLerman's praise could easily come across as sycophantic, but this is Pacino. You can't blame him. And it's clear the love and awe is genuine.\n\"Just to see that in you, to see that drive as well and to work with you is just a dream for me,\" the younger star says.\n\"Also, you know, we were together for a while, we were together five, six months,\" says Pacino. \"So we get to work together and know each other and be, uh, on the wire together, so to speak. We were walking the wire together.\"\nThey built a \"friendship and trust and understanding\" with each other and all the cast and crew, says Pacino. \"Because we're all trying to make this thing happen, make it alive. That's something we did together. It was fun.\"\nAt a time where he could be forgiven for taking it easy, the past few years have been very busy for the actor, whose career in entertainment now spans six decades.\nHunters comes off the back of the release of The Irishman, Martin Scorsese's mob epic featuring the all-star trio of Pacino, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci; his performance as union leader Jimmy Hoffa earned him best supporting actor nominations at the BAFTAs, Screen Actors Guild awards and the Oscars.\nHe missed out on all three, with Brad Pitt cleaning up for his portrayal of stuntman Cliff Booth in Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon A Time\u2026 In Hollywood, but you get the impression Pacino, who has done the awards ceremony conveyor belt many times over - winning the best actor Oscar for Scent Of A Woman in 1993 - doesn't need the trophies.\n\"Well, I think they're fun for people that watch\u2026 but being part of it is a little stressful.\"\nWhile it's a \"great perk\" to have an Oscar nomination, he says \"you never quite learn how to handle it\".\n\"When I was younger, it was a different thing for me than it is now. Now, I try to just look at it for what it is.\"\nAs well as the reunion of Pacino and De Niro, and the famous de-ageing technology used in the film, one of the other talking points about The Irishman is its length; at three-and-a-half hours, you need to make sure you set some time aside for it.\nBut now he's delved into the world of streaming, with 10 episodes in the Hunters series, The Irishman must have seemed like easy work in comparison?\nIt was a \"different\" experience, says Pacino, who goes on to talk about viewers' experience, rather than his own.\n\"I know that the film itself on the big screen, The Irishman, has a different reaction, people have [a different reaction] to it than when they see it [on TV]. It's slightly different. And it's got to do with the environment.\"\nHe starts to talk about his theatre work, brushing Lerman's hand in apology for doing most of the speaking.\n\"You know, you do plays - I don't mean to go on here but it's very interesting, if I could get this across. It's very interesting because sometimes you're doing a play - I come from the theatre, really - and\u2026 I've done plays that didn't work, mainly because the core around it was not right for the play.\n\"So the environment you're in when you're watching something and what it looks like is, it dictates to you sometimes how you engage in the film you're looking at, how it affects you.\n\"I mean, I did Richard III in Boston in a big theatre, with [an] iron set and stuff, and half the people left. And then we went to a church afterward and did a church, and I came out of the pulpit and it was the biggest success I ever had.\n\"You have to understand that. It takes a while, it took me a long time to understand that. Now, for instance, if you watch The Irishman on Netflix, you can stop it, and have an intermission on your own... I don't know. But it is a different experience when you see the big screen.\"\nWe really are being wrapped up now, but Pacino, clearly excited about his new show, still has a point to make about Hunters.\n\"You have to understand, [Hunters] goes in all different directions, just so you know,\" he says. \"You got nine more episodes to see.\"\nAs we say our goodbyes, both actors shake my hand.\nPacino laughs as I'm quietly and politely - but firmly - told my time is up. \"I talk too much.\"\nHunters is out on Amazon Prime Video from Friday 21 February","26":"Oscar winner and nine-time nominee Al Pacino is a veteran when it comes to the biggest night of the year in Hollywood - but he has admitted to Sky News that \"you never quite learn how to handle it\".\nThe 79-year-old star says being up for a prized statuette is a \"great perk\" of the job, but says the ceremony can get \"a little stressful\".\nFame has also changed, he says, since he was first on the Oscars radar almost 50 years ago - for arguably his most iconic role, as Michael Corleone in The Godfather, in 1973.\nThis time round, Pacino is nominated for the best supporting actor prize for his portrayal of labour union leader Jimmy Hoffa in Martin Scorsese's gangster epic The Irishman.\nHe is up against his co-star Joe Pesci, who came out of film retirement to play mob boss Russell Bufalino. It is not the first time the two Hollywood heavyweights have been up for the same award, with both nominated for best supporting actor in 1991; Pacino for Dick Tracy, Pesci for Goodfellas.\nPesci took that round, and Pacino went on to win the big prize for best actor two years later, for his performance as blind alcoholic Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade in Scent Of A Woman.\n:: Listen to the Backstage podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker\nThis year, Once Upon A Time\u2026 In Hollywood star Brad Pitt is the odds-on favourite to win the supporting actor gong, but Pacino is taking it all in his stride.\nSpeaking about the awards while promoting his new Amazon Prime TV series Hunters, Pacino said he would be taking his three grown-up children to the ceremony later this evening.\n\"Well, I think they're fun for people that watch\u2026 but being part of it is a little stressful,\" he told Sky News. \"But at the same time, it's a great perk for you if you have an Oscar nomination and it makes you feel\u2026\"\nHe tails off, before adding: \"You never quite learn how to handle it though.\n\"When I was younger, it was a different thing for me than it is now. Now I try to... I try to just look at it for what it is, you know, and I admire it, and the whole fact that I'm involved...\n\"I'm very happy, I'm going to bring my three kids to the Oscars, they're coming with me.\n\"It's a good thing for kids too, you know, it's fun. It's fun for everybody.\"\n:: Listen to the Backstage podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker\nThe Irishman, an adaptation of the non-fiction book I Heard You Paint Houses, also reunites Pacino with Robert De Niro.\nAn epic saga of organised crime in post-war America, it is told through the eyes of De Niro's character, Second World War veteran Frank Sheeran, a hitman who worked alongside some of the most notorious figures of the 20th century.\nSpanning several decades - and with digital de-ageing technology, or \"youthification\", used to capture its stars during different periods of their lives - it offers an account of the story behind Hoffa's unsolved murder.\nIt is up for 10 awards at the Oscars, including best picture and best director for Scorsese, as well as the supporting actor nods, although De Niro is a notable omission from the best actor shortlist.\nPacino says the Academy Awards now are a little different to those he first attended, describing them now as \"almost like a Super Bowl\".\n\"I remember when I was younger and looking at it, it was so exciting to see the people in that world,\" he says. \"It's changed a little bit in the sense that our world is different now.\n\"And fame is different... but it still has that tradition.\"\nSky Cinema's live and exclusive coverage of the 92nd Annual Academy Awards starts on Sunday night at 12.30am.

Alasdair was an extraordinary person; very talented and, even more importantly, very humane.\n\"He was unique and irreplaceable and we will miss him greatly.\n\"We would like to thank Alasdair's many friends for their love and support, especially in recent years, together with the staff of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Glasgow, who treated him and us with such care and sensitivity during his short illness.\"\nGray has asked that his body be donated to medical science, meaning there will be no funeral.\nTributes poured in for the beloved figure, with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon saying on Twitter: \"Such sad news. Alasdair Gray was one of Scotland's literary giants, and a decent, principled human being.\n\"He'll be remembered best for the masterpiece that is Lanark, but everything he wrote reflected his brilliance. Today, we mourn the loss of a genius, and think of his family.\"\nFrancis Bickmore, Gray's editor and publishing director at Canongate, said: \"What sad news this is that Alasdair Gray is gone. It seems hard to believe that Alasdair was mortal and might ever leave us.\n\"No one single figure has left such a varied legacy - or missed so many deadlines - as Alasdair Gray. At least through Gray's phenomenal body of work he leaves a legacy that will outlive us all.\n\"His voice of solidarity and compassion for his fellow citizens, and his forward-looking vision is cause for great celebration and remembrance.\"\nTrainspotting author and fellow Scot Irvine Welsh tweeted: \"Alasdair Gray was a unique talent. In Lanark, and 1982 Janine especially, he wrote two of the greatest Scottish novels and influenced a creative generation. #RIP.\"\nProfessor Sir Anton Muscatelli, principal of the University of Glasgow, also paid tribute.\nHe said: \"Alasdair Gray was one of the true greats of Scottish art and literature. He was writer in residence at the University of Glasgow in the late '70s and was always a strong and close friend of the university.\n\"It is with great sadness that we mark his passing, but the many works he produced, from his magnificent novel Lanark to the inspiring murals that adorn the city, ensure that his legacy will live on for many years to come.\"","28":"Alec Baldwin and his wife Hilaria have announced they are having a baby, after going through two miscarriages last year.\nFitness instructor Hilaria shared a video showing her bump and the sound of their unborn child's heartbeat on social media.\nThe 36-year-old said she did not \"have the words to express how this sound makes us feel\" in her post, shared on Instagram.\n\"Just got the great news that all is well and all is healthy with this little munchkin,\" she said.\nThe baby will be the couple's fifth child.\nBaldwin, 62, shared the same video, simply captioning it: \"My, oh my...\"\nHilaria suffered two miscarriages in 2019.\nOpening up about the second one in November, she said she and the actor were \"devastated\" at being told their unborn baby had died at four months.\nThe couple married in 2012 and have three sons and a daughter together.\n:: Listen to the Backstage podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker\nAs well as his four children with Hilaria, 30 Rock star Baldwin is also father to 24-year-old model Ireland from his marriage to Kim Basinger.\nHe is uncle to Hailey Bieber, Justin Bieber's wife.","29":"A man has been charged with murder following the discovery\u00a0of a body of a 15-year-old boy in a village in Cheshire.\nAlex Rodda was found dead on a country lane in Ashley shortly before 8am on Friday.\nMatthew Mason, 18, of Ollerton, near Knutsford, has been charged with murder and possession of a bladed article in a public place.\nHe has been remanded in custody and is due to appear at Crewe Magistrates' Court on Monday.\nAlex's family, from Knutsford, around four miles from Ashley, said the teenager \"loved life\".\nIn a statement, they said: \"Alex was a very loving, caring, kind, loyal and, most of all, trusting young boy.\n\"He loved life and made friends wherever he went.

She said: \"I remember taking him to one of the tables and just leaving him.\"\nShe walked away to the bar and got a drink.\nShe said she did not tell anyone about it and added: \"I kept my distance from him and continued to keep my distance from him.\"\nMr Prentice asked if at any time she encouraged any of the things she described Salmond doing and she responded: \"No, never.\"\nDuring cross-examination the woman confirmed to defence counsel Gordon Jackson QC that she regarded the incident at the Christmas party as groping. She said: \"He touched my breasts, my waist, my hips.\"\nMr Jackson said that in a succession of interviews with police there was not one mention of what the woman said had happened at the event.\nThe woman said she was surprised because she thought she had told the police.\nThe woman confirmed that she had been in contact with other complainers in the case.\nShe said: \"I would not be encouraging people to make a complaint.\" She said some asked for advice and added: \"In every case I made it clear it was a decision for them to take.\"\nSalmond, 65, pleads not guilty to 14 charges involving 10 women, including one of attempted rape and one of sexual assault with intent to rape.\nAnother alleged victim, an SNP politician, told the court of a \"surreally awful\" moment when Salmond allegedly put his hand on her leg during a journey in his official car.\nShe sat in the back of a government car with Salmond while her husband was a passenger in the front. The married couple were being given a lift to a train station after a night out.\nThe woman told the court that Salmond put his hand on her leg, above her knee.\nShe said she felt embarrassed by it. She also said that she hoped he would move his hand but it stayed there until they got to the train station.\nShe said nobody noticed Salmond's actions.\nShe added: \"I was absolutely gobsmacked. The first minister - who I really looked up to - had done that and I was gobsmacked.\n\"People were talking - my husband was talking - that's what made it bizarre - everything was still continuing to go on.\n\"I just froze. I sat there thinking 'just stop'.\"\nShe said she didn't tell her husband about what happened as he was in a good mood at being able to get a ride in an official government car.\nShe said that her husband also admired Salmond and looked up to him.\nShe added: \"I suppose when you look back at things you realise how much you excuse a person because of who they are.\n\"It is so hard to explain how much he meant to our party and you just put things to one side. I didn't think it was nothing. It was because of who he is and what he was.\n\"Who on earth was I going to tell and what on earth were they going to do about it?\"\nSalmond has pleaded not guilty to all charges.

For unknown reasons, he left the premises alone at about 7.16pm, and police say his phone was switched off shortly afterwards.\nOn Saturday evening, Sussex Police released a CCTV video which they believe shows the 33-year-old walking alone on the night.\nIn the new footage, a man seen to the right of the camera walks along White Hill, opposite the Elephant and Castle pub, away from the town at 7.19pm. The same man is then spotted on the same road, walking back towards Market Street, at 7.37pm.\nIt comes after a CCTV image of Mr Knott, which has been confirmed by his family and is believed to be the last known sighting of him, was released by police on Friday. The photograph places him walking up Market Street and back towards the pub at 7.41pm.\nPolice are hoping the firefighter's \"distinctive walk\" in the video could help people remember seeing him on the night.\nChief Inspector Sarah Godley said: \"This new CCTV footage comes as a result of footage from a number of premises being reviewed in the area.\n\"Although it is before the confirmed CCTV image we released of Anthony walking up Market Street at 7.41pm on the evening of his disappearance, it may jog someone's memory from that night.\n\"Anthony has a distinctive walk and we believe in releasing this footage more people may come forward with information. We are appealing for anyone in this CCTV footage to make contact with us so we can confirm whether this is Anthony.\"\nMeanwhile, Mr Knott's best friend has spoken to Sky News about his disappearance, saying he has simply \"vanished\".\nSteve Shepherd said: \"It's just out of character.

He's vanished and we don't know where.\"\nMr Shepherd said Mr Knott had plans with his fiancee to be home by 2am, as well as having made plans with him for Saturday afternoon to \"go for a few drinks\".\nHe said: \"Everything was normal. Nothing out of the blue.\n\"The only suggestion was that he might have gone outside to get some cigarettes and gone outside because he looked a bit anxious.\"\nThere is nothing to suggest Mr Knott left the Lewes area and police are focusing their search efforts in the town.\nThere are \"increasing concerns for his welfare and fears that he may have come to some harm\", the force has said.\nHis fiancee, Lucy Otto, has described his disappearance as \"a complete mystery\".\n\"I don't understand how someone can just walk out a pub and disappear,\" she told Sky News in an interview on Christmas Eve.\n\"There's no eyewitness statements, there's not much CCTV, there's nothing really to go on.\n\"And to be gone for this long, I just don't get it, I just do not understand it.\"\nThere has been no activity on Mr Knott's phone since 7.20pm on the day he went missing and his bank card has not been used, Ms Otto said.\nIn a direct message to her fiance, she added: \"If he is watching and you're worried and you're thinking, 'Oh I can't come home, this is too big now', honestly, you don't realise how many people want you back regardless of the situation you left in - if that is the case.\n\"So just come home, please just come home.\"\nThe search for Mr Knott has included local officers, drones and the police dog unit, as well as support from fire brigades, helicopter service, search and rescue staff and the Coastguard agency.\nMr Knott is white, approximately 6ft tall, of medium build and with medium-brown, short and gelled hair.\nHe was wearing a black long-sleeve top, a dark denim suit-style jacket, dark denim jeans and black shoes.\nAnyone who may have seen Mr Knott or who has other relevant information is asked to contact Sussex Police by phoning 101, quoting Operation Barnstaple.

with many choosing to pare back gift lists and focus presents on kids rather than adults and extended family.\n\"Our monthly income tracker showed that while disposable income remained stable at around \u00a3217 a week during fourth quarter, previously seen trends of growth are starting to slow and consumers remain highly budget conscious.\"\nThomas Brereton, retail analyst at GlobalData, said that while Asda had \"used almost identical excuses\" for its struggles, it appeared to have been hit \"worse than its competitors\".\nHe added: \"While Q4 in isolation shows ASDA in a dim light - emphasised by the lack of usual detail of net sales growth, and no explicit mention of UK operations in Walmart's earnings release - 2019 as a whole was rather encouraging for ASDA, spending much of the year battling with Tesco to be the best performer of the 'big four'.\n\"This should provide confidence in ASDA's ability as a standalone retailer as it looks to spin off from Walmart and IPO [initial public offering] in 2021-22, and should continue to focus investment in its resilient online division, which grew sales 10.3% year-on-year, well ahead of the 7.1% total online retail growth for 2019.''\nThe big four supermarkets - Tesco, Asda, Morrisons and Sainsbury's - have all been struggling with shrinking market share as shoppers opt for discounting rivals Aldi and Lidl.\nAsda and rival Sainsbury's sought to meet the competition by agreeing a multibillion-pound merger, but the move collapsed after it was blocked by the Competition and Markets Authority in April last year.\nAlso last year, the chief executive of Walmart said it was \"seriously considering\" a flotation of the UK arm of the business but said such an undertaking would take \"years\" to organise.\nAsda, Britain's third biggest supermarket by sales, is the only one of the big four not to have a UK stock market listing.","40":"The British Medical Association is asking its members how they feel about its stance on assisted dying.\nThe union's position since 2006 has been that it opposes all forms of assisted dying but last year medics voted for a new poll.\nA similar consultation by the Royal College of General Practitioners is also under way, with results due next month.\nThe Royal College of Physicians has recently dropped its opposition and vowed to take a neutral stance.\nThe BMA will ask its 160,000 members if the union should support, oppose, or take a neutral stance on any law change to permit doctors to prescribe drugs for eligible patients to administer themselves to end their own lives.\nThey will also be asked if doctors should be able to administer drugs to eligible patients with the intention of ending life, while general opinions and experiences will also be invited.\nResults will be discussed at this year's annual conference in Edinburgh.\nDr John Chisholm, chairman of the BMA's medical ethics committee, said: \"Physician-assisted dying is an extremely sensitive issue that understandably ignites a broad range of strong personal views across both the general public and the medical profession.\n\"Doctors and medical students have a particular interest in discussions around legislation because any change in the law would impact on them not just personally, but professionally.\n\"Therefore, this poll will allow us to gather information about the breadth of views held by our membership, which will then inform any future policy decisions and how we respond to any proposals for a change in the law.\"\nDr Helena McKeown, BMA representative body chairwoman, added: \"The BMA represents doctors and medical students across the UK, and it's imperative that the views of all of our members are heard and considered in the development of policy on this very important topic.\n\"We're asking every member to please make the time to take part in our survey, so as to ensure we have the best debate we can in June.\"\nLord Chancellor Robert Buckland said the government had no plans to launch an inquiry into current laws preventing euthanasia.\nHe added: \"Personally, I have grave doubts about the ability of legislation to be watertight when it comes to the potential for abuse.\n\"But, as Lord Chancellor, you will understand that whatever my personal view, I must listen to all sides of the debate on this complex issue.\"","41":"The search is on to find the winner of a \u00a341m EuroMillions jackpot - and the hunt is focused on Dorset where the ticket was bought.\nThe mystery person matched all five main numbers - 18, 31, 32, 38 and 48 - and the two Lucky Star numbers - 04 and 12 in the 3 December draw.\nThey have until 31 May to make their claim, but Camelot is urging National Lottery players to check, double-check and triple-check their tickets.\nThe operator has only revealed the county where it was bought in case the winner wants to remain anonymous.\nThe \u00a340,957,696.60 prize is the seventh EuroMillions jackpot to be won in the UK this year - the biggest ever prize of \u00a3170,221,000 was won in October.\nAndy Carter, senior winners' adviser at The National Lottery, said they were \"desperate\" to find the winner and \"reunite them with their winnings\" -

someone out there could literally be sitting on a fortune.\"\nHe added they have \"champagne on ice and our fingers crossed that the lucky winner comes forward to claim their win\".\nCamelot has the discretion to pay prizes if tickets are stolen, lost or destroyed, but only if the player has submitted a claim in writing within 30 days of the draw - and following an investigation to determine the validity of their claim.\nIf it is decided it is valid, then the prize will be paid 180 days after the draw - but if no one comes forward before the deadline, the money - including interest - will go to help National Lottery-funded projects across the UK.","42":"An inquiry into 5G networks and the UK's broadband is being launched to look at how realistic the government's pledge is to bring high-speed internet to every home and business by 2025.\nWhat is needed to achieve that, how realistic the ambition is and what it will mean for people and businesses will be looked into by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) select committee.\nBoris Johnson has faced questions over the viability of his promise to bring gigabit-speed broadband to the whole of the UK in the next five years, which would significantly increase average internet speeds for many parts of the country.\nDCMS committee chair Julian Knight said: \"The delivery of full-fibre broadband is critical to the success of the UK, particularly the need to ensure that our businesses of the future are equipped with a reliable, future-proofed network no matter where they are based.\n\"The government has said it wants to achieve this nationwide roll-out by 2025.\n\"We'll be carrying out a reality check to find out what steps must be taken now if this target is to be reached.\"\nThe committee will also look at the role controversial new 5G technology could play and will examine schemes such as the Shared Rural Network to improve mobile connectivity.\nThe network is a joint venture between the four major mobile operatores - O2, Vodafone, Three and EE - and the government which includes sharing infrastructure as well as building new phone masts.\nMr Johnson has previously promised to make \"poor mobile signal a thing of the past\".\nOn Wednesday, a cross-party group of US senators wrote a letter to British MPs expressing their \"significant concern\" with Mr Johnson's decision to hand Chinese telecoms company Huawei an infrastructure role in distributing 5G in the UK.\nCritics claim Huawei has close links to the Chinese government and its equipment could be used for espionage purposes, although the company has always denied this.\nDonald Trump was reported to have been \"apopletic\" with Mr Johnson during a phone call last month after the UK pushed ahead with allowing Huawei to build \"non-core\" parts of the UK's 5G networks.","43":"5G is the next generation of mobile communication technology that will be rolled out across the UK over the next couple of years.\nIt wasn't until 3G was launched in the mid-2000s that web browsing became ubiquitous on smartphones.\nThe increased data capacity of 4G allowed for video and music streaming to become a regular part of the smartphone experience too.\nImprovements on speed, bandwidth and access will be a dramatic part of 5G's roll-out, and the increase in data is set to impact mobile communications for many more parties than just consumers.\nWhat is it?\nMobile phones communicate with electromagnetic radiation, and electromagnetic waves on a particular part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n5G uses a new band of the electromagnetic spectrum to send signals through the air - a portion from 22Ghz to 86GHz, wavelengths that are larger and thus less powerful than even visible light.\nThere are issues with the higher frequencies used by 5G. They will have a shorter range and so more cell towers will be required, and the smaller waves could struggle to provide coverage inside - but the impact will be more data, more often, and consumers, businesses and industries can all benefit from that.\nWhile not as damaging as a full ban, analysis commissioned by Britain's industry body for mobile firms, MobileUK, says the restriction could delay the country's 5G roll-out by up to two years and cost the country \u00a36.8bn in lost profits.\nWhat will it do?\nWhere these profits will come from is still uncertain, but it is assumed that 5G will deliver productivity benefits due to the telemetry it allows in industrial processes.\nThe smart systems and industrial processes that produce telemetry data will be the key beneficiaries of 5G. It will be less noticeable for consumers, where even under 4G videos are often capable of playing as quickly as they are being downloaded.\nInstead, the increased data collection in smart objects, from household devices through to driverless cars, is expected to herald a new age of telemetry and data analysis that can improve our lives.\nAccording to the UK network Three: \"5G will enable transformative technologies to be deployed across key industries that will make everyone's lives better.\n\"5G's super-fast speeds, capacity and low-latency could have a huge impact across our health services, in our manufacturing processes and overall in improving the nation's productivity.\"\nThe firm added that it expected consumers to use 13 times more mobile data in 2025 than they use today.\nA spokesperson for EE told Sky News: \"We're still in the very early stages of this new generation of mobile technology, and today 5G is about giving customers a faster, more reliable connection - particularly in busy places.\n\"New devices, like the Nreal AR glasses we've showcased that provide immersive experiences even on the move, will change how consumers interact, game, and watch,\" they added.\nEE continued to say: \"5G introduces new levels of reliability, capacity and flexibility for a wide variety of connections and uses, whether at home or at work.\n\"As we get to more mature 5G technologies, from around 2022, we'll start to see a wider range of connected things for consumers, a surge in the 'Internet of Things' and connected homes, and the beginning of a revolution in how UK businesses operate.\n\"Next generation network technologies like 5G will help ensure we're ready for the explosion in connected devices, new experiences and uses, and amount of data that we'll all be using in the years to come.\"\nA spokesperson for the government said the benefits of 5G were key to its industrial strategy.\n\"We are determined to seize all the opportunities of 21st century technology and 5G has the potential to generate significant economic and social benefits in the UK,\" they said.\n\"The technology will enable innovation in manufacturing, smart cities and augmented reality, and bring mobile speeds up to 10 times faster than current 4G. This means downloading an HD film will take seconds rather than hours.\n\"5G could also revolutionise sectors such as driving, with sensors in vehicles sharing real time data of incidents and bring advances in healthcare.\"\nIs it safe for your health?\nLast year, a parliamentary petition with more than 29,000 signatures called for an independent inquiry into the health and safety risks of the next generation of mobile technology.\nThe government turned down the request, noting there are multiple such enquiries taking place in the UK and internationally to monitor whether electromagnetic radiation is harming people.\nThe parts of the electromagnetic spectrum which are used by 5G communications - the portion from 22Ghz to 86GHz - are non-ionising and incapable of breaking molecular bonds, knocking off electrons from atoms for instance, and causing the molecule to have an electric charge, which is how radiation causes certain cancers.\nHowever, there is a concern that the the 26 GHz band (between 24.25 GHz to 27.5 GHz) which is being sold internationally as part of the 5G spectrum - although not in the UK - could interfere with how weather satellites monitor water vapour.","44":"The total number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK is now 273, a rise of 67, the biggest in a 24-hour period.\nThe new total is up from a figure of 206 which the Department of Health and Social Care released yesterday.\nEarlier today, it was announced two more people have tested positive in Wales and last night it was revealed three more were diagnosed with the virus in Northern Ireland.\nThe vast majority of cases are in England. London has at least 51 cases, the South East 41 and the South West 35. The region with the smallest number is the North East and Yorkshire with at least 18.\nAmong those in England that have tested positive is a student from Oxford University, who the institution said self-isolated before they attended any university or college events after feeling ill.\nThe Department of Health and Social Care says more than 23,500 people have been tested for the virus.\nCalls to the NHS 111 service have increased by more than a third compared with the same period last year, with 120,000 extra calls in the first week of March, the department said.\nThe department's website said: \"As of 9am on 8 March 2020, 23,513 people have been tested in the UK, of which 23,240 were confirmed negative and 273 were confirmed as positive. Two patients who tested positive for COVID-19 have died.\"\nEarlier, health secretary Matt Hancock said on Saturday night that the government was doing everything in its power to be ready to delay the threat from coronavirus - which has now killed more than 3,600 people worldwide.\nHe said: \"Public safety is my top priority. Responding to coronavirus is a massive national effort and I'm working with colleagues across government to ensure we have a proportionate emergency bill, with the right measures to deal with the impacts of a widespread COVID-19 outbreak.\n\"We plan for the worst and work for the best, and the NHS is working 24\/7 to fight this virus.\"\nThere are concerns the NHS may struggle to cope if the virus spreads quickly, so self-isolation will be used to try to slow it down.\nMillions of volunteers could be given four weeks off work to help take the strain off the health service in the event the coronavirus outbreak becomes a pandemic, under plans proposed by Downing Street.\nThree million experienced people who offer their time to health or social care services for free would have their paid employment protected for up to a month to ensure patients can be properly cared for.\nMinisters are also looking at increased use of video-conferencing facilities within courts to make sure trials can go ahead, and the possibility of allowing retired NHS staff to work in the health service again on a temporary basis.\nProfessor Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners, told Sky News using retired doctors was \"a good idea\" if it was done carefully.\nSpeaking to the Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme, he said: \"Those doctors, because they would likely to be a higher risk group, would not do face-to-face patient contact but there's lots of other things they can do, like managing 111, providing online care for patients.\n\"I am confident they would respond positively. That's what doctors are trained for. Doctors tend to respond very positively in states of emergency.\"\nAmid fears that large numbers of people could be quarantined, if only at home as a result of self isolation, Mr Hancock hailed the \"good example\" set by a group of people released from hospital quarantine on Sunday, who had been repatriated to the UK last month from the coronavirus-hit Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan.\nThe group of 30 Britons and two Irish nationals were allowed to leave Arrowe Park hospital in the Wirral, having been given the all clear.\nFigures of where coronavirus cases have been identified by English local authority have revealed a wide divergence depending on where in the country they are occurring.\n:: Listen to the Sophy Ridge on Sunday podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker\nHertfordshire has the most with 13, with Devon close behind on 12.

He loved every aspect of it, from researching the many single malt distilleries to visiting them and tasting their whiskies.\n\"He was always pleased to acquire the bottles that he was searching for over the years. His mission was to collect a bottle that represented every single distillery, but his favourite was always Bowmore with his preferred whisky being Black Bowmore.\"\nThe collection will go on sale via the Whisky Auctioneer website over two auctions from 7 to 17 February and 10 to 20 April 2020.","48":"On board a Flybe flight from London Heathrow to Newquay on Tuesday morning, I spoke to cabin crew who had no idea whether it would be their last-ever journey for the airline.\nThey were worried, tense and pessimistic about keeping their jobs - especially after the demise of Monarch and Thomas Cook.\nBut they had to carry on like there was no issue. They sprung into action - helping a passenger who had a panic attack after we battled through Storm Brendan and were diverted to Bristol Airport about 150 miles away.\nTo me, it was obvious the wait and the worry of the past few days had been agony.\nWe wanted to get to Newquay to look at the impact it would have on businesses and people in Cornwall if Flybe went bust - they operate nine routes from Newquay and four trips a day between London and the region's only airport.\nBut a couple of hours into our journey, the news broke that Flybe has been saved - for now.\nWe arrived at Exeter Airport, Flybe's headquarters. Here they have over 1,000 staff members which include engineers, office staff and even the CEO.\nThey've got a training academy here and the airport mainly operates Flybe services. In the small arrivals hall, passengers were greeted with hugs, huge sighs of relief, and elation to hear that the airline had been saved.\nSpeaking to staff at the airport in the evening, they too were delighted. The duty manager told Sky News: \"Without Flybe many of the ground staff, security and engineers will probably have to be laid off.\"\nIt was business as usual the following day.\nAt Exeter airport, commuters arrived early to get on a flight to Manchester. On the return leg, as passengers and the crew stepped off the propeller plane, the captain raised his fist and gave me a thumbs up with a huge grin on his face, clearly happy he still has his job.\nI spoke to him later in the airport terminal, and he said: \"We are all mighty relieved. Many of us have been worried and tense over the past few days, but I'm so glad we've pulled through.\"\nOne elderly couple, who were picking up their son from the airport, told me: \"It's very good news, very important for Exeter airport. Our son has just flown from America via Manchester.\n\"If it had gone under it would have been catastrophic.\"\nA 21-year-old university student told me: \"If I didn't get back to Exeter today, I'd have missed the start of uni. It's a lifesaver really.\"\nThe airline's demise would have left a huge vacuum that was hard to fill.\nWhile there will be talks over the next few days about the stability of this rescue deal, there will be millions of passengers and thousands of staff across the country very happy - for now.","49":"Don't Wait Up star Tony Britton has died aged 95, his TV presenter daughter Fern has announced.\nWriting on Twitter, she hailed her father as a \"great actor, director and charmer\".\n\"May flights of angels sing thee to thy rest,\" she added.\nBritton was best known for starring alongside Nigel Havers and Dinah Sheridan in the BBC sitcom Don't Wait Up between 1983 to 1990.\nHe also appeared in Thames Television's Robin's Nest, which aired from 1977 to 1981, together with Richard O'Sullivan and Tessa Wyatt.\nHis film credits included The Day Of The Jackal, Operation Amsterdam and Sunday Bloody Sunday.\nActor and comedian Sanjeev Bhaskar paid tribute, writing: \"Profound condolences Fern and gratitude for the joy and entertainment your Dad brought to me and millions of others. Sending love and strength.\"\nDownton Abbey star Peter Egan said on Twitter: \"Very sad to see the passing of the legend Tony Britton. A wonderful actor and light comedian. Condolences to his family. A lovely man too.\"\nBenidorm actress Sherrie Hewson said: \"Sending much love @Fern_Britton a truly wonderful man a real star in everyone's eyes! He will never be forgotten RIP\".\nJohn Challis, best known for playing Boycie in Only Fools And Horses, hailed Britton as \"one of life's gentlemen\".\nBritton was born in Birmingham and attended Edgbaston Collegiate School, Birmingham, then Thornbury Grammar School, Gloucestershire.\nIn the Second World War he served in the army and worked in an aircraft factory.\nLater Britton joined an amateur dramatics group in Weston-super-Mare before turning professional, appearing on stage at the Old Vic and with the Royal Shakespeare Company.\nIn 2013, Britton appeared as the Earl of Gloucester in a production of Shakespeare's King Lear at the Old Vic in London, directed by Sir Jonathan Miller, who died last month.\nBritton had two children, Fern and scriptwriter Cherry Britton, with his first wife Ruth Hawkins.\nHis second wife was Danish sculptor Eva Castle Britton (nee Skytte Birkenfeldt) with whom he had a son, Jasper Britton.","50":"The number of care providers cutting support for vulnerable adults has doubled in the last year because of financial pressures, a charity has said.\nResearch by Hft, which supports adults with learning disabilities, suggested 20% of the 80 providers surveyed had offered care to fewer people in order to balance the books or meet rising wage bills.\nAnd a third of those questioned had cut staff, while almost half had shut parts of their organisation.\nBilly Davis, public affairs and policy manager for Hft, said the sad reality was that the social care sector has \"run out of options\".\nHe added: \"The lack of a sustainable cash injection for the sector has seen providers resorting to offering care to fewer people to manage spiralling costs at a time when demand for social care is widely acknowledged to be growing.\n\"The fact that providers are now having to take what they reported to be their least favoured cost-cutting measures illustrates that these decisions are not being taken lightly.\n\"A lack of alternatives has left providers with no choice but to make decisions culturally at odds with the way they want to run their organisations, such as handing back services and, ironically, shedding staff in the midst of a sector-wide recruitment crisis.\n\"Given the fragility of the social care sector, there's never been a more important time to hear the views of the organisations providing care for some of the most vulnerable people in society.\n\"It's clear that at its heart social care funding is, and continues to remain, a national issue that requires a national solution.\"\nHft called on the Department for Health and Social Care to bring forward \"long overdue\" proposals on reforms for the long-term future funding of adult social care.\nIan Hudspeth, chairman of the Local Government Association's Community Wellbeing Board, said: \"The provider market is an essential part of the care and support system and councils also work closely with local care providers to ensure a good quality market of services.\n\"However, given the serious funding and demand pressures facing adult social care, there is a known gap between what providers say they need and what councils pay.\"\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: \"Everyone should have access to the best quality, compassionate care and we are providing councils with access to an additional #1.5 billion in 2020-21 to meet rising demand and continue to stabilise the social care system.\n\"There are complex questions to address, which is why we will seek to build cross-party consensus. But, as the Prime Minister has said, we will deliver on our promises and bring forward a plan for social care this year.\"","51":"The end of 18 years of war in Afghanistan could be in sight as the

eventual permanent ceasefire but only if there is a significant and nationwide reduction in violence.\nThe deal will include guarantees from the Taliban that Afghanistan will not be used to attack the US or its allies.\nIt also provides details for the phased withdrawal of America's 12,000 troops and other foreign forces from Afghanistan over 18 months.\n\"Following lengthy negotiations between the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan and the United States of America, both parties agreed to sign the finalised accord in the presence of international observers,\" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said.\nHe said both sides would make arrangements for the release of prisoners, including 5,000 Taliban members who are mostly being held in Afghan government jails.\nHowever, Kabul has made no public announcement about the release.\nAfter nearly two decades of war the path to peace will not be an easy one, and President Donald Trump's reputation is heavily on the line.\nMr Pompeo said: \"The only way to achieve a sustainable peace in Afghanistan is for Afghans to come together and agree on the way forward.\"\nThis may prove more difficult as the Taliban has refused to talk to Afghan president Ashraf Ghani's government after he was declared the winner earlier this week of September's election.\nHis rivals and the Taliban quickly denounced his re-election despite the government being considered key to finding lasting peace in the country.\nGermany and Norway have both offered to host the intra-Afghan talks, but no venue has yet been set.\nThe seven-day \"reduction of violence\" covers all of Afghanistan and also applies to Afghan forces, as well as the US and the Taliban.\nThey have all committed to end attacks for that period, which for the Taliban includes roadside bombings, suicide attacks and rocket strikes.\nUS peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad has led the negotiations with the Taliban since September 2018 and has been key to the latest developments.\nMr Trump made removing US troops from Afghanistan a central tenet of his 2016 presidential campaign so if a peace deal is signed he can claim to have made good on his promise.\nHowever, if it fails, Mr Trump risks being branded naive by Democrats, and willing to sacrifice the security of US soldiers for the sake of getting his pledge done and dusted.\nThe Pentagon would not say whether the US had agreed to cut the number of troops in Afghanistan to zero, however the Taliban's spokesman said it expects a complete withdrawal.\nNATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said it was a \"critical test of the Taliban's willingness and ability to reduce violence, and contribute to peace in good faith\".","52":"Airbus has agreed to settle bribery and corruption allegations by UK, US and French authorities in a deal that will cost it \u20ac3.6bn (\u00a33bn).\nThe European aeroplane maker, based in Toulouse, disclosed the scale of the financial hit hours after confirming that it had reached an \"agreement in principle\" with authorities in each country.\nCourt hearings will take place in each of the three jurisdictions on Friday to give final approval to the deal.\nAirbus said it would book a \u20ac3.6bn provision for the penalties in its annual accounts for 2019.\nIt did not give a breakdown in its statement of how much would go to each country or what part of the total was accounted for by other costs.\nStill, the scale of the provision makes it likely that the settlement surpasses the \u00a3671m penalties handed to Rolls-Royce for similar allegations two years ago.\nAirbus said its case related to \"allegations of bribery and corruption and to inaccuracies in filings made with the US authorities pursuant to the US international traffic in arms regulations\".\nIn Britain, the Serious Fraud Office confirmed in a separate statement that it had reached a deferred prosecution agreement in principle with the company, subject to court approval.\nIt said no further information could be provided until after the hearing.\nThe SFO and the French financial prosecutor's office had begun investigating Airbus in 2016 with the US Department of Justice joining in 2018.\nThe allegations related to irregularities concerning third party consultants.\nAirbus employs more than 130,000 people worldwide including 13,500 in the UK at sites in Bristol, north Wales, Newport, Portsmouth and Stevenage.","53":"Airlines have called on the government to underwrite hundreds of millions of pounds in regulatory and air traffic control charges as they seek to navigate through the escalating coronavirus crisis.\nSky News has obtained a letter sent on Wednesday by Airlines UK, the industry's main lobbying group, to Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, in which it calls again for a package of emergency support.\nIn the letter, Airlines UK urged the government to suspend - rather than defer - air passenger duty payments for six months following the end of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIt called for the waiving of air traffic control (ATC) and Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) charges for the whole of 2020, \"with payments guaranteed by [the government] so National Air Traffic Services and the CAA can continue to be paid and function as critical enablers of the wider UK aviation landscape, both through the current crisis and then into the recovery phase\".\nAirlines UK, whose members include British Airways, easyJet, Ryanair and Virgin Atlantic, also repeated a call for a moratorium on all litigated claims under EC261, the European law which requires airlines to refund passengers for cancelled flights.\n\"Carriers should also be permitted to issue vouchers instead of refunds and, should refunds be required, carriers should be permitted to defer payment until the crisis period is over and as defined by air traffic volumes, rather than time period,\" the group said.\nThe letter from Airlines UK comes a day after Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, told British carriers that they could expect to engage in discussions with the government about \"bespoke\" aid \"only as a last resort\".\nMr Sunak said airlines would need to exhaust the resources of their existing shareholders and financial stakeholders before the government would consider an injection of debt or equity.\nTim Alderslade, Airlines UK chief executive, said: \"A million people work in UK aviation all over the country.\n\"It is one of the UK's international assets, as the third largest globally behind only China and the US.\n\"We welcome that the Government will enter into negotiations with individual airlines, but we also want to work with them on policy actions that could be taken now which could also have a considerable impact.\"\nMr Alderslade added that airlines welcomed Mr Sunak's confirmation that the government would be prepared to enter talks with individual airlines about \"bespoke support\".\nThe latest industry data suggests that aggregate passenger revenues will fall globally by $252bn as a result of the virus outbreak.\nMarkets with severe travel restrictions now cover 98% of global passenger revenues, Airlines UK said.\nMr Alderslade also urged Mr Shapps to provide more detail about the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme unveiled by Mr Sunak late last week.\n\"Please can we urge that further clarity is provided as soon as possible owing to the severe cash pressures that airlines are facing,\" he wrote.\nMr Sunak's comments held open the possibility that the government could take a stake in some British airlines, but underlined the remoteness of such a prospect.\nThe Treasury is keen for major airline shareholders such as easyJet's Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou and Virgin Atlantic's Sir Richard Branson to inject further sums before they can turn to the government for more support.\nMr Sunak also hinted that the Treasury was close to unveiling a further credit facility for companies which do not have an investment grade credit rating.\n\"I have listened to feedback that suggests some companies including airlines are uncertain whether they can access this Facility - which is for companies rated as investment grade or equivalent,\" he wrote.\n\"I am in discussions to resolve this uncertainty and further announcements will be made shortly.\"\nSky News revealed last week that Rothschild, the investment bank, had been asked to advise ministers on a package of measures, and that one option could include direct taxpayer investments in airline shares.","54":"Airlines may have to cut passenger numbers, fly to fewer long-haul destinations or only operate from airports with longer runways in the future because of global warming, scientists say.\nA study has found warmer air and changing winds are making it increasingly difficult for aircraft to take-off.\nIt suggests airports with shorter runways will require planes to reduce weight to compensate.\nResearchers say it may mean airlines have to reduce the number of passengers on board aircraft or carry less fuel and fly to fewer destinations.\nProfessor Paul Williams, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Reading and co-author on the study, said: \"Warm air and slow winds make it harder for planes to get off the ground, and climate change appears to be making both of these factors more common.\n\"Our study is the first to combine measurements of air temperatures and wind speeds to calculate the precise impact on take-offs.\n\"Reducing passenger numbers clearly results in a financial hit to airlines.\"\n:: Listen to the Daily podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker\nHe added: \"Reducing the amount of fuel being carried is an alternative way of shedding weight, but limits the distance that can be travelled.\n\"Another possibility is extending runways to allow higher take-off speeds to be reached but this would mean covering these holiday paradises in even more tarmac.\"\nThe study, published in the journal Climatic Change, involved the analysis of more than 60 years of weather and aircraft data from 10 Greek airports.\nResearchers looked at take-off conditions for two types of aircraft - the medium-sized passenger jet Airbus A320, and the smaller de Havilland DHC8-400 - and took into account headwind, surface conditions, temperature and runway slope.\nThe team of scientists and engineers from the UK and Greece calculated the take-off distance needed and the maximum possible take-off weight for both the planes.\nThey found the take-off distance required for the A320 increased by an average of 2.7 metres per year, while for the DHC8-400 it was by 1.4 metres per year.\nAt one airport, the required take-off distance for the A320 increased by 98.6 metres between 1988 and 2017, the study found.\nResearchers discovered it also took both aircraft a longer time to climb after leaving the ground.\nThe research was carried out by the University of Reading along with Cranfield University, the University of West London and the Athena Research Centre in Greece.","55":"Two airline groups have revealed they expect to lose tens of millions of pounds due to the coronavirus and its effect on travel.\nQantas and Air France-KLM reported financial results in the early hours of Wednesday and both companies pointed to the outbreak as a major factor.\nCOVID-19, the name for the acute respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus, has infected more than 75,000 people, most of them in China, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering.\nMany Chinese residents are prevented from travelling as the government tries to limit the virus's spread and many airlines have suspended flights through the country.\nAustralia-based Qantas reported underlying pre-tax profit was down 0.5% to A$771m (\u00a3397m) in the six months ending 31 December.\nBut it estimated that the coronavirus would deliver a A$100m (\u00a351m) to A$150m (\u00a377m) hit to underlying earnings before interest and tax by the end of the financial year.\nThe hit will come from Qantas reducing its capacity on Asia flights by 15% until at least the end of May, affecting flights to and from China, Hong Kong and Singapore, an announcement it made alongside its results.\nThe fall in international visitors will also affect domestic flights in Australia and those between Australia and New Zealand, as around 8% of Qantas domestic flights are attached to an international ticket.\nReductions of around 5% will be made to Qantas and subsidiary Jetstar's flights between Australia and New Zealand, while Australian domestic flights are expected to be cut by 2%. Other parts of the network, such as the US and UK, are not affected.\nQantas chief executive Alan Joyce said: \"The capacity we're taking out is the equivalent of grounding 18 aircraft across Qantas and Jetstar until the end of May, which in turn impacts about 700 full-time roles.\n\"To avoid job losses we'll be using leave balances across our workforce of 30,000 and freezing recruitment to help ride this out. We'll also take advantage of having some aircraft on the ground by bringing forward planned maintenance.\"\nBut Qantas expects to derive at least some benefit from the fuel costs which have dropped from the lower demand for air travel due to the virus.\nMeanwhile, Air France-KLM said it expected the coronavirus outbreak to wipe between \u20ac150m (\u00a3125m) to \u20ac200m (\u00a3167m) from its earnings by April, assuming China flights remained suspended until then.\nThe Franco-Dutch airline group cancelled its mainland China flights through March and based its April assessment on this but chief financial officer Frederic Gagey added: \"Obviously if it lasts longer, the impact will be heavier.\"\nMainland China flights made up 5.5% of the group's network traffic last year and, despite January showing \"significantly positive\" revenue growth, it all \"changed quite brutally\" once the extent of the virus outbreak became clear, Mr Gagey said.\nBut, like Qantas, Air France-KLM expects to benefit slightly from lower fuel costs, with the airline group saying its fuel bill is likely to fall by around \u20ac300m this year.\nAir France-KLM's revenue was up 1.9% in the fourth quarter and 3.7% in 2019 to \u20ac27.1bn (\u00a322.6bn).","56":"A surfer is in hospital after the jet ski that rescued him from a violent swell was hit by two waves, tossing him into the air.\nCanadian-born big wave surfer Alex Botelho was tossed around in the powerful surf off the central coast of Portugal before support staff rescued him.\nHe got into trouble in a big swell when, following a wipeout, he was rescued by his partner Hugo Vau on a jet ski, the Guardian said.\nWith both men on board, they were unable to outrun a wall of white water rushing up behind them before the craft was hit by another wave from the front.\nHe was competing in the Nazare Tow Surfing Challenge, held in an area which sees some of the biggest waves in the world.\nVideo of the incident shows around a dozen people drag an unconscious Mr Botelho out of the water and onto the beach, where he was put on a backboard and taken to an ambulance.\nThe World Surf League (WSL) said in a statement: \"Big wave surfer Alex Botelho was involved in a very serious incident during the Nazare Tow Surfing Challenge.\n\"He was rushed to the hospital and we now have an update on his condition. Currently, he is stable and conscious. He will stay at the hospital for further evaluation.\n\"A heartfelt thank you to the safety and medical teams for their quick response. We are wishing Alex a full and speedy recovery.\"\nNic Von Rupp, another big wave surfer, said it was difficult to watch, saying what happened to his \"brother\" was \"heartbreaking\".\nThe former fishing village has been a hot spot for big wave surfing since 2011, when Hawaiian surfer Garrett McNamara set a world record for the biggest wave ever surfed at 78 feet (23.77 metres).\nThat was beaten in 2017 by Brazilian surfer Rodrigo Koxa, who rode an 80 foot (24.38m) wave, again at Nazare.\nWaves there reached an average of 45 feet (14m) on Tuesday, the WSL estimated, helped by storms out in the ocean and light winds, calling conditions \"exceptional\".\nThe monstrous swells are increased by an underwater canyon three miles (5km) deep which ends where the North Atlantic meets the shoreline.","57":"Health Secretary Matt Hancock has been criticised after refusing to reveal details of a contract between the Department of Health and Amazon to provide NHS health advice via the voice assistant Alexa.\nA heavily redacted form of the contract was obtained by Privacy International, citing concerns about the extent of NHS data which the company would be able to access.\nThe Alexa service was launched in the UK in July, when Mr Hancock told Sky News that the device was already being used by millions to ask health questions.\nIt does not allow Amazon to access patients' healthcare data, one of the most lucrative markets for data in the world.\nAmazon said the core details of the contract allowed it to receive the NHS advice data in a format which Alexa could use, and then to read that out to people using voice search.\nEva Blum-Dumontet, of Privacy International, told Sky News that the organisation was \"not opposed in principle to cooperation between Amazon and the NHS\".\nBut the sensitive nature of people's engagements with the NHS meant that the pair needed to be transparent about that collaboration, and what data Amazon had access to.\n\"At the moment, we can't see what NHS data has been provided to Amazon,\" Ms Blum-Dumontet said.\nShe noted the exercise has also been a free advertisement for Amazon, featuring the health secretary \"going around the media talking about how this was going to change people's lives by accessing NHS content through Amazon devices\".\nThe documents uncovered by Privacy International reveal that Amazon had the right to review all of the NHS press material made about the Alexa tie-up, as well as use the NHS logo in its own promotions.\n\"There are a lot of advantages for Amazon, but what is the NHS getting out of this?\" Ms Blum-Dumontet asked.\nAdditional privacy concerns have been raised about the sensitivity of the searches which Alexa users could be making if they are seeking official medical guidance.\nEarlier this year it was revealed that Amazon staff often listen to Alexa recordings and share them in chat rooms in order to enhance Alexa's ability to understand human speech.\nAmazon says that employees don't have direct access to information which can identify the account holder, and that users could delete these searches from their device by saying \"Alexa delete my last search\" after making them.\nAccording to the Labour Party's shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth, the deal shows that the government has been \"highly irresponsible\" and is \"in the pocket of big corporate interests\".\nThe Liberal Democrats spokesperson Tom Brake accused the party of \"selling off NHS data for nothing\".\nThe Conservative Party has not responded to requests for comment from Sky News.\nA spokesperson for the Department of Health told Sky News the issue was an NHS England matter to comment on, despite the contract being between the Minister for Health and Social Affairs and Amazon.\nIf you have additional information regarding this story, please contact Alexander Martin via aj.martin@sky.uk or securely on mobile using the private messaging app Signal on +44 (0)7970 376 704.","58":"A new scientific discovery suggests that chemical reactions on the sea floor of Saturn's moon Enceladus could mean there are enough energy sources to support life.\nThe surface of Enceladus is covered by between 18 to 24 miles of thick clean ice, making it one of the most reflective bodies in the solar system. However, centred beneath the ice at the moon's south pole there is believed to be an enormous ocean.\nScientists at the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) have developed a new model which explains how the plumes of gases and frozen sea spray which have erupted through cracks in Enceladus' surface suggest a complex world beneath its icy crust.\n\"The dynamic interface of a complex core and seawater could potentially create energy sources that might support life,\" said SwRI's Dr Hunter Waite, the principal investigator behind NASA's Cassini mission spectrometer analysis of the moon.\n\"While we have not found evidence of the presence of microbial life in the ocean of Enceladus, the growing evidence for chemical disequilibrium offers a tantalising hint that habitable conditions could exist beneath the moon's icy crust,\" Dr Waite added.\nOrganic compounds which are necessary for life were discovered in water plumes by NASA's Cassini probe. These plumes are known to mysteriously erupt from the moon's surface, although when the organic compounds were discovered scientists urged caution on assuming they meant there was life there.\nThe moon was discovered by the British astronomer William Herschel in 1789 using what was then the largest telescope in the world, measuring 1.2m across.\nAlmost 230 years later, the Cassini spacecraft conducted another fly-past of its southern pole, travelling through one of the ice world's mysterious cryovolcanic plumes which had been discovered to be erupting from the moon.\nCassini sampled the water-rich plumes, suspected to originate from a vast liquid ocean beneath the surface of Enceladus, and discovered organic compounds - molecules which contain carbon and are essential to all known life.\nHowever, NASA said: \"The subsurface ocean evidence supports the inclusion of Enceladus among the most likely places in our solar system to host microbial life.\"\nThese compounds, including the molecule methanol, have now been detected in a much more massive quantity than previously expected, using the IRAM radio telescope, which is 30m across, in the Spanish Sierra Nevada.\nJupiter's much bigger moon Europa is also known to have liquid water under its surface, and both it and Enceladus could be possible habitats for extraterrestrial microbes, scientists believe.\nThe water on Europa is kept from freezing by warming tidal forces generated by the gravity of the giant gas that the moon orbits.","59":"A competition probe into Amazon's proposed investment in the food delivery app Deliveroo is \"speculative and not supported by evidence\", the two companies have warned regulators.\nSky News has learnt that Deliveroo has informed its major investors that a joint submission to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) included a robust dismissal of watchdogs' reasons for launching an in-depth investigation.\nDetails of the companies' objections to the CMA's decision to order a phase two inquiry are expected to be published this week.\nA shareholder in Deliveroo said on Monday that the submission accused competition authorities of a series of misunderstandings about Britain's food delivery market.\nIn particular, it is understood to say explicitly that Amazon, which pulled out of takeaway deliveries in 2018, had no plans to re-enter the sector.\nThe CMA has argued publicly that by allowing Amazon to lead a $575m (\u00a3440m) fundraising by the UK tech company, it could diminish competition by removing the possibility of the internet behemoth returning to the market.\nIn evidence submitted to the regulator, Amazon and Deliveroo are understood to argue that it has also failed to take account of the different business models employed by the two companies.\nIn addition to restaurant takeaways from chains such as Byron, Pizza Express and Wagamama, Deliveroo has been experimenting with grocery deliveries.\nThe companies' submission argues, however, that Amazon's grocery delivery service competes with those of Sainsbury's and Tesco while Deliveroo's is more akin to that of Uber Eats.\nThe two companies are also said to dispute the CMA's suggestion that Amazon would exert \"material influence\" over Deliveroo by virtue of its planned investment, which would equate to an undisclosed minority stake in the British business.\nUnder the terms of the deal unveiled last May, Amazon would have a seat on the Deliveroo board but would not have superior voting rights to any other shareholder-director, according to one investor.\nThe string of private rebuttals of the CMA's arguments is at odds with the conciliatory tone of the two companies' public statements.\nA spokesperson for Deliveroo declined to comment on the content of its submission but said: \"Deliveroo has been working closely with the CMA and will continue to do so.\n\"We are confident that we will persuade the CMA of the facts that this minority investment will add to competition, helping restaurants to grow their businesses, creating more work for riders, and increasing choice for customers.\n\"Deliveroo is a British company operating right across the country and this investment will be particularly beneficial to the UK economy.\"\nThe publication of the CMA's issues statement is a further staging-post ahead of a deadline for its statutory decision in June.\nLast week, the regulator made an unexpected intervention in another deal in the burgeoning restaurant delivery sector - Just Eat's \u00a36bn merger with Takeaway.com of the Netherlands.\nThe hypothetical nature of the CMA's interventions has caused alarm among tech investors concerned that its approach may act as an inhibitor to innovation.\nDeliveroo is likely to need to secure alternative funding in the coming months if Amazon's investment is blocked outright.\nAmazon recently denied a Bloomberg News report that it had offered a loan to Deliveroo while the CMA investigation runs its course.\nThe US-based company said: \"A homegrown UK business like Deliveroo should have broad access to investors and supporters.\n\"Amazon believes that this investment funding will lead to more pro-consumer innovation by helping Deliveroo continue to build its world-class service and remain competitive in the restaurant food delivery space by creating more highly skilled jobs, innovating in the restaurant food delivery sector, and developing new products for customers.\"\nThe CMA responded by saying: \"Our initial investigation found UK consumers could be negatively affected if the deal went ahead, as Amazon could be discouraged from re-entering a market in which there are only a small number of companies that act as the middleman between restaurants and customers, and that it could also damage competition in the emerging market for online convenience grocery delivery.\"","60":"More than 100 migrants, including seven children, have been intercepted in the English Channel -

This is absurd.\n\"We just really wanted to make sure we weren't in that situation again.\"\nMr Camp said that he then put a clause on tickets for Sheeran's Divide stadium tour that meant that they could not be resold - but that Viagogo ignored the request when he made them aware of the change.\nHe added that three other resale sites complied with the new terms and conditions.\nHe claimed tickets for Ed Sheeran's tour were cheaper than most international acts, adding that normal prices were usually around \u00a350 or \u00a375.\n\"Our theory is that we want everybody to be able to come to a show,\" he said.\n\"We'd rather put on a million more shows for a lower price.\n:: Listen to the Backstage podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker\n\"I'd rather keep people happy and people saying 'you know what, we'll do that again some time'.\"\nHe told the jury that people who arrived at Sheeran's gigs with a ticket bought on a secondary ticketing site were offered the chance to buy an official ticket at face value and given help to claim back the money from the site in question.\nHe was giving evidence for the prosecution at the trial of Peter Hunter and David Smith, who traded as Ticket Wiz and BZZ.\nThey deny fraudulent trading over the sale of tickets for big events and shows, such as Harry Potter And The Cursed Child, and the RHS Chelsea Flower Show.\nJonathan Sandiford, prosecuting, opened the case by saying that Hunter and Smith used software and bots to make multiple applications for tickets on sites such as Ticketmaster, in order to hide their true identities.\nMr Sandiford added that the pair bought more than \u00a34m worth of tickets, and resold them for \u00a310.8m on secondary ticketing websites, between June 2015 and December 2017.\nHunter, 51, and Smith, 56, both from Crossfield Road in north London, deny fraudulent trading and possessing an article for fraud.","69":"The new environment secretary has dismissed fears that chlorinated chicken and hormone-injected beef could be rolled out in UK supermarkets.\nGeorge Eustice refused twice to rule out the possibility - which has been raised by campaigners who warn food standards will be cut as part of a trade deal with the United States.\nBut pressed again he told Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday \"we won't make any moves on our standards\".\nWashington has already declared it wants \"comprehensive market access\" for agricultural goods as part of a new post-Brexit trade deal.\nThe issue has notably focused on chlorine-washed poultry, which is widespread in the US but has been banned in the EU since 1997.\nMr Eustice, who comes from a farming background and was promoted in last week's reshuffle, told Ridge there are \"no plans\" to change the law.\nAsked to reaffirm his predecessor Theresa Villiers' commitment not to import chlorinated chicken or hormone-treated beef, he said: \"We're absolutely clear as a government we will not take risks either without food standards and when it comes to animal welfare we will be projecting our views on animal welfare on to the international stage.\"\nPressed again, he said \"lactic acid washes\" are now used more in the US than chlorine, which is unlikely to allay fears over animal welfare.\nWhen asked for the third time, he confirmed: \"What I'm saying is we won't make any moves on our standards.\n\"We've got a clear position in this country that it is illegal to sell chlorine-washed chicken, illegal to sell beef treated with hormones, we have no plans to change those things.\"\nIt comes after Ms Villiers reportedly said last month: \"We will not dilute our strong environmental protections, food safety and animal welfare.

Fourteen states including California, Texas and Massachusetts are holding primaries to choose presidential nominees.\nThis bigger-than-ever election day might be the decisive moment in selecting the Democratic candidate. Former New York City mayor and billionaire Michael Bloomberg will only enter the Democrat race officially at this point.\nAPRIL\nThe government's ban on plastic straws comes into force in England. Currently we dispose of 5 billion plastic straws, 300 million stirrers and two billion plastic shafted cotton buds each year.\nMAY\nLocal elections on 7 May. Given that former mayor of London Mr Johnson is now prime minister all eyes will be on Sadiq Khan's battle for re-election.\nVictory would make him a real contender as a future leader of a troubled Labour Party. Could a surprise surge by independent Rory Stewart rain on his parade?\nLabour's Andy Burnham in Manchester, and Tory ex-John Lewis boss Andy Street in the West Midlands are also up for re-election, along with five other mayoral contests, 40 police and crime commissioners, and 118 English councils.\nJUNE\nThe month-long UEFA European Football Championship kicks off on 12 June. England and Wales qualified to play, as did Spain, France, Russia, Italy, Poland, Ukraine, Turkey, Belgium, Czech Republic, Finland, Sweden, Croatia, Denmark, Austria, Netherlands, Germany, Portugal and Switzerland.\nIn a new experiment to mark UEFA's 60th anniversary, 12 nations are hosting games. The final and semi-finals will take place at Wembley Stadium in July.\nJULY\nThis is the EU's deadline for the UK to seek an extension to the \"transition period\" beyond the end of the year. Mr Johnson is writing into UK law that there will be no extension.\nThe Democratic Convention in the swing state of Wisconsin will be the moment of truth for the party to choose their candidate and their running mate for vice president.\nBy the end of the month much of the world's attention will be tuned into the Olympics which begin in Japan on 24 July.\nAUGUST\nMore Olympics. Following the doping ban, will Russian athletes compete under neutral flags?\nThe Republicans have left their national convention late in the hope that it will be a re-coronation of Mr Trump.\nIf so, the biggest excitement will be whether he dumps vice president Mike Pence - so far he says he won't. If Mr Trump has fallen by the wayside by then, expect a real dog fight in Charlotte, North Carolina (another swing state).\nSEPTEMBER\nThe Liberal Democrat and Labour Party conferences won't be happy events after the kickings both received in the last election. Expect continued rumblings over party leadership.\nAfter Labor Day (7 September), what the Americans call their general election begins. The first presidential debate is already scheduled for 29 September in Indiana.\nOCTOBER\nThe Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham. Then back to work in Westminster. By now, the first fruits should be starting to appear from the government reviews into constitutional reform and foreign and defence policy.\nThere will be two more US presidential debates in Indiana and Michigan and the sole vice presidential debate is scheduled in Utah. They organise these things better over there.\nNOVEMBER\nThe first Tuesday of the month, 3 November, is US election day. Contests take place from the presidency, through a third of the Senate and all of the House of Representatives, all the way to local state officials. America's choices will be consequential for the rest of the world.\nImmediately after the US election, climate change will top the international agenda as the UK hosts the COP 26 Summit in Glasgow. COP stands for Conference Of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.\nSome 30,000 delegates from around the world are due to attend to test past performance and hammer out new commitments on carbon emissions. It will be a big test for the former Conservative MP and minister Claire Perry who is COP 26 president.\nDECEMBER\nThis month marks the first anniversary of Mr Johnson's election victory and we are back to where we began.\nIf the government has its way the UK will throw off the last shackles of the EU on New Year's Eve and payments to the union will cease.\nBut what agreements for future relationships, especially on trade, will be in place? Will the UK avoid what some here call \"a clean break\", while others fear \"crashing out\" over a \"cliff edge\"?","83":"One of the UK\u2019s largest operators of mobile telecoms towers is exploring a sale amid soaring demand for access to wireless communications networks.\nSky News has learnt that 3i Infrastructure, a vehicle part-owned by the FTSE-100 investor 3i Group, has appointed Greenhill, the investment bank, to find a buyer for Wireless Infrastructure Group (WIG).\nWIG operates more than 2,000 mobile masts across the UK and is particularly active in rural areas where mainstream wi-fi networks are weak.\nSources said that 3i Infrastructure had received a number of unsolicited approaches about a takeover of WIG.\nThe prospective sale has emerged during a general election campaign in which the universal provision of high-speed broadband has become an important battleground.\nThe Conservatives have pledged billions of pounds of investment to improve internet speeds, while Labour's pledge to nationalise BT Group's Openreach division and provide free broadband to homes and businesses was one of the biggest policy bombshells of the campaign.\n3i Infrastructure owns a 91% stake in WIG, which is expected to be valued at more than \u00a3300m.\nIt was unclear on Friday how much debt WIG, which is based in Bellshill in Scotland, is carrying.\nThe company has a so-called small cell business unit which delivers high-capacity infrastructure into public venues including shopping centres, office blocks and stadiums.\nIt makes money by renting access to its masts to network operators.\nWIG was responsible for launching the UK's first 5G-ready, fibre-connected, outdoor small cell network in Aberdeen in 2017 in partnership with Telefonica, the owner of the O2 mobile network.\nTelefonica and Vodafone, which jointly own CTIL, have signalled that they may seek to offload the business, which owns 16,500 masts.\nCity sources said that WIG was interested in exploring a combination in some form with CTIL.\nOn Friday, 3i Infrastructure announced that it was selling some of its other UK assets, including stakes in the Mersey Gateway Bridge and Ayrshire College, generating proceeds of \u00a3194m.\n3i declined to comment on its plans for WIG on Friday.","84":"Adam Crozier, the former boss of ITV, is in talks to become the chairman of one of Britain's biggest market research groups in the wake of its $4bn takeover.\nSky News has learnt that Mr Crozier has been approached by Bain Capital, the buyout firm which acquired a 60% stake in Kantar last year, about the role.\nAn appointment has yet to be finalised, but industry sources said that Mr Crozier could sign a deal with Bain before the spring.\nBain bought the controlling shareholding in Kantar from WPP Group, the FTSE-100 marketing services provider built over more than three decades by Sir Martin Sorrell.\nSir Martin, who stepped down last year and has since founded S4 Capital, a 'new era' marketing holding company.\nHis successor at WPP, Mark Read, has been reshaping the company by offloading a number of subsidiaries and merging some of its agency brands.\nWPP has retained a minority stake in Kantar, which employs about 28,000 people and is one of the world's biggest market researchers.\nKantar is currently seeking a new chief executive to replace Eric Salama.\nIf Mr Crozier does take the Kantar chairmanship, it would see him reunited with Ian Griffiths, who was recently appointed as its chief financial officer.\nThe pair worked together at ITV, which Mr Crozier left in 2017.\nHe has since become chairman of ASOS, the online fashion retailer, and Vue Entertainment, the cinema chain.\nBefore joining ITV, Mr Crozier ran the Football Association and Royal Mail Group.\nHe was also previously a senior executive at Saatchi & Saatchi, the advertising agency.\nNeither Bain nor Mr Crozier could be reached for comment on Saturday.","85":"NHS A&E departments have treated more than a million people this year than in 2018 - with flu and norovirus outbreaks arriving earlier, heaping pressure on the health service.\nThe latest NHS weekly figures show services are coming under pressure with nearly 900 beds taken up due to norovirus outbreaks.\nThe figure is almost double the amount at the same time last year.\nThe weekly figures, released on 19 December, also show the number of patients who spent seven days or more in hospital were 339 fewer than the previous week.\nLess than one in 10 major A&Es implemented a temporary divert, where patients are directed to other accident and emergency departments.\nThis figure is down on both last week and the same week last year.\nThe number of people arriving at A&E by ambulance was high at 2,500 - an increase of 2.6% on last year, according to the latest weekly figures.\nThere were more than 12,000 additional calls to NHS 111 for urgent medical advice over the last week compared to the seven days before.\nThere was also nearly 70,000 more calls compared to the same period last year - an increase of 20.5%.\nLast week's A&E statistics from November showed there have been over a million more patients in A&E compared to 2018, and almost three million more than 2014.\nThe latest figures from Public Health England (PHE) show that influenza-like illness continues to increase, and is above baseline threshold levels with more people in hospital compared to the previous week.\nAn NHS spokesperson said: \"Hospitals now have more beds open than this time last year, but flu and norovirus have kicked in a bit earlier so are adding pressure at a time when the NHS is already looking after significantly more people than ever before.\"The NHS has already looked after a million more people in A&E this year compared to last, and as we head into the holiday period it's really important that the public help our hardworking staff by getting their flu vaccine now, using the free NHS 111 phone and online service for urgent medical needs, seeing their local pharmacist for minor ailments and ensuring they are stocked up on the medication they need.\"","86":"It was the case of the infamous Dr Crippen more than a century ago, on trial in court number one at the Old Bailey in London, which paved the way for the law banning cameras in court.\nEven then, in 1910, cameras were discouraged from capturing court proceedings and the press were supposed to apply for permission.\nBut a series of snatched photographs of the American homeopathic doctor, in the dock alongside his mistress Ethel Le Neve, were splashed all over the papers of the day, infuriating the judiciary and politicians.\nIn the years after Crippen was convicted and hanged for the murder of his wife, Parliament passed the new law.\nIt read: \"No person shall (a) take or attempt to take in any court any photograph, or with a view to publication make or attempt to make in any court any portrait or sketch, of any person, being a judge of the court or a juror or a witness in or a party to any proceedings before the court, whether civil or criminal; or (b) publish any photograph, portrait or sketch taken or made in contravention of the foregoing provisions of this section or any reproduction thereof.\"\nAlthough that law banned, not just photographs but sketches during trials, the rules were later relaxed to allow the press to employ the talents of court artists, to sketch a likeness of the accused and others involved in a particular trial.\nSome artists were better than others, but they've been a part of the media landscape for generations.\nIt meant the day-to-day coverage of trials, in the country's most high profile court, were told through court artists' sketches and reporters' shorthand scribbles.\nThat wasn't really a problem for the newspapers, but with advent of radio and television, the drama of those court proceedings had to be relayed through correspondents like me after the fact, on live cameras outside court.\nLike the court artist, some reporters are better than others at capturing the sense of drama from inside court - it is an art form in itself.\nMore than a century on from the Dr Crippen trial, court number one at the Old Bailey will make history again, when the first televised proceedings will be aired within months.\nInitially, it will be a small part of the trial process which will be available to film.\nThe sentencing remarks made by the judge at the end of a successful prosecution may not sound like much, but they are often expansive and summarise the case.\nThere is definite drama in the excoriating remarks a judge can send a defendant's way and of course we all want to know how many years behind bars those convicted of some truly awful crimes will receive.\nAllowing the cameras in, even on this limited basis, is none-the-less a massive step for the government and the judiciary to take. They have, understandably, been deeply concerned about the impact a television camera in court might have on legal proceedings.\nThey've viewed with horror televised court cases in other countries and fear trials could be sensationalised and vulnerable witnesses put off from taking the stand, for fear they'll be publicly criticised or ridiculed.\nThe broadcast media now effectively on trial here as well. The judiciary has taken a significant step in allowing our cameras in.\nIt's up to us to report sensitively and responsibly, if we're to make a success of the initiative and hope to extend it to other parts of the trial process.","87":"Bethany pops in for a flying visit with Katie and Stevie to talk Al Pacino, Narcos: Mexico and To All The Boys 2.\nFollowing the Brits, we get all the backstage gossip from music's biggest knees-up and focus on upcoming TV shows to watch now that awards season is over.\n:: Listen to Backstage on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker\nDon't forget to subscribe if you like what you hear, and if you want to get in touch then drop us an email at backstage@sky.uk","88":"Astronomers have detected alien signals - that is, signals from a foreign galaxy - being emitted in an unusually regular 16-day cycle.\nFast radio bursts (FRBs) are not in and of themselves unusual - the first was detected in 2007 - but previous observations have shown them to be mostly emitted at random.\nWhile there have been some bursts which repeated, as astronomers discovered previously, they have never been seen repeating in such a steady cycle.\nThe origin of FRBs hasn't been established yet, although the dominant theories regarding them suggest the signals are produced by rapidly rotating bodies such as neutron stars or black holes.\nResearchers studying data from the radio telescope used by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) found the FRB signals arrived on Earth up to twice an hour for four days before suddenly stopping, only to start up again twelve days later.\nIts origin was located within a medium-sized spiral galaxy about 500 million light-years away, making it the closest FRB discovered to date.\nThe researchers observed its cycle for a total of 409 days and believe that it could be tied to the emitting object being locked in an orbit which lasts 16 days.\nHowever they say that, considering that FRBs are enormously powerful bursts of electromagnetic energy, they could be from a neutron star - although if this was the case the star would be expected to wobble, and not display the same kind of smooth cycle.\nThe researchers detailed their findings in a pre-print article published on arXiv, ahead of receiving peer review.\nIn 2017, Professor Avid Loeb, from the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics in the US, proposed that FRBs could be leakage from planet-sized alien transmitters.\nHe said that rather than being designed for communication, they would more likely be used to propel giant space ships powered by light sails, which would bounce the beams off a huge reflective sheet to provide forward thrust.\nThere is currently no evidence supporting the hypothesis that FRBs are connected to alien civilisations.","89":"Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has bought a Beverly Hills mansion from media mogul David Geffen in a record-breaking transaction for Los Angeles, according to the Wall Street Journal.\nThe world's richest man is said to have paid $165m (\u00a3126m) for the property - known as the Warner Estate - which would make it the most expensive home in the Los Angeles area.\nIt beats the previous record set last year when Fox Corporation chief executive Lachlan Murdoch bought the Chartwell estate in the city's Bel Air neighbourhood for $150m (\u00a3115m).\nThe 9.4-acre Warner Estate was built in 1937 by its namesake, Warner Bros Studio boss Jack Warner, and is kitted out with huge terraces, gardens, guest houses, a tennis court and a golf course.\nIt is listed in The Legendary Estates of Beverly Hills book, which was quoted in the Journal as saying: \"No studio czar's residence, before or since, has ever surpassed in size, grandeur, or sheer glamor the Jack Warner Estate on Angelo Drive in Benedict Canyon.\"\nIn 1990, Mr Geffen purchased the property for $47.5m (\u00a336m), which was also a record for Los Angeles at that time.\nHe then reportedly gutted the home except for a wooden floor said to be the one that Napoleon stood on as he proposed to Josephine, and wood panels believed to be carved by a Chippendale, according to the Los Angeles Times.\nIt is not yet clear whether Mr Bezos, whose net worth is an estimated $131bn (\u00a3100bn), will use the estate as his main residence.\nThe billionaire is also said to have purchased $90m (\u00a369m) worth of undeveloped land in Los Angeles from the estate of the late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, and a further three apartments in an $80m (\u00a361m) deal in New York earlier this month.\nIt comes a week after the New York Post said the 56-year-old and his girlfriend, Lauren Sanchez, were scouting out possible mansions in Los Angeles.\nHe had been searching for a new home since last year, the Post said.","90":"Senator Amy Klobuchar has pulled out of the race to become the Democrat presidential candidate and will back Joe Biden.\nShe is heading to Dallas and plans to join Mr Biden at his rally there on Monday, her campaign said.\nThe Minnesota senator is the second person to withdraw in 24 hours after Pete Buttigieg ditched his bid on Sunday night.\nFormer vice president under Barack Obama, Joe Biden has seen his campaign rejuvenated after winning the South Carolina primary a few days ago and the support of Ms Kloubchar will be a further boost.\nThe lawyer and former prosecutor finished third in the New Hampshire primary but struggled to repeat that success.\nShe was hoping to be the moderate choice for the Democrats but her chance of occupying that role weakened when Mr Biden confirmed he was entering the contest.\nThe senator had one of the more memorable campaign launches, standing in a Minnesota snowstorm last February to show her \"grit\" and Midwestern sensibilities.\nMs Klobuchar's support for Mr Biden is an attempt to fight off the leading challenge from progressive Democrat candidate, Bernie Sanders.\n:: Listen to Divided States on Apple podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, and Spreaker\nHer decision to pull the plug on her campaign comes a day before Super Tuesday -

which could save hundreds of jobs.\nSirius said that subject to certain conditions it expected to be able to recommend the 5.5p a share offer to investors - many of them local people who have ploughed in their own savings - though it would leave many out of pocket.\nThe share price was as high as 22p a year ago and peaked at 44p in 2016, though had fallen to 4.1p by the close of trading on Tuesday.\nSirius has been reviewing the North Yorkshire polyhalite mine after scrapping in September a plan to raise about \u00a3400m in a bond sale, delaying the project.\nThe review included a search for a new partner and investor to help fund the development. The UK government had declined to back it.\nThe plan involves tunnelling under the North York Moors National Park to exploit what Sirius has said is the world's largest deposit of polyhalite.\nThe mineral would be transported through a 23-mile long tunnel to Teeside, from where it would be shipped to customers.\nLast year, Sirius said 1,200 jobs related to the development of the mine would be lost if the company could not raise the funds needed to proceed.\nThe project would be the first deep mine to be sunk in Britain for 40 years.\nBut it has struggled to attract financing and analysts have questioned whether there is a market for the kind of fertiliser it would produce.\nIt has also attracted opposition from campaigners concerned about its impact on the North York Moors landscape.","92":"Apple has agreed to pay up to $500m (\u00a3391m) to settle a lawsuit accusing the tech giant of intentionally slowing down older iPhone models.\nPhone owners could get up to $25 (\u00a319.56) per handset if a California judge approves the settlement.\nThe smartphone maker and lawyers representing consumers agreed to a deal stemming from Apple's admission in 2017 that it was slowing down the performance of older devices in order to avoid unexpected shutdowns related to battery fatigue.\nThe admission saw Apple offering discounted battery replacements at $29 (\u00a322.69).\nBut customers claimed they had already spent hundreds of dollars on replacing their handsets because Apple did not reveal why their phones were slowing down.\nSome consumers in the case said they may not have bought new phones if they had known they could just buy new batteries.\nApple did not admit wrongdoing.\nHowever, as part of the settlement it has agreed it will pay between $310m (\u00a3243m) and $500m, including a sum of about $93m (\u00a373m) to lawyers representing iPhone customers.\nConsumers who were named in the lawsuit will get up to $3,500 (\u00a32,738) each and the rest will will be distributed to iPhone 6, 6S, 7 and SE owners, given they meet the eligibility requirements related to the operating system they had running.\nThey must also file claims in order to receive the money - but if too many people file claims the $25 award could see a reduction.","93":"Buying a phone these days can easily set you back \u00a31,000. So what makes the major models on the market worth that kind of cash?\nThe three best-selling phone makers in the UK are Apple, Samsung and Huawei. Apple has the lion's share of the market, with 50% of sales over the last year according to Stat Counter.\nSamsung has 28% of the market, but Huawei - which alongside other Chinese competitors is eating into Apple and Samsung sales on a global basis - is a solid third, with 9.7% of consumers deciding to buy the Chinese company's phones.\nHere is a deep dive into how these firms' flagship devices compare against each other, and below that a dive into what unique features they're each offering to win over consumers:\nThe standard iPhone 11 comes with a dual-camera system that can shoot 4K video, and includes an ultra wide camera which allows users to zoom out for sweeping 120-degree landscape photographs.\nThe company could be facing regulatory action in the EU over its lightning cable however, which isn't inter-operable with other major phone brands.\nBoth of the Pro models use a triple-camera system which brings in a Telephoto lens which offers a 2x optical zoom - meaning unlike the 6x digital zooming feature, you can get twice as close to the action without undermining the image quality.\nApple debuted its Ultra Wide camera lens on the iPhone 11, letting users capture four times more scene than they could on its normal wide angle lens.\nShooting in low light situations is frustrating for all smartphone photographers, and Apple's night mode on the iPhone 11 allows users to avoid turning on flash which can distort colours in order to get a brighter picture.\nThe iPhone 11 also uses the next generation of its \"Smart HDR\" technology which uses artificial intelligence to blur the background of a shot when it features a face, and apply highlights and shadows to skin tones to reproduce the look of images taken with professional photography equipment.\nApple's phones remain the most expensive on the market, and for a long time that was justified by how exceptionally advanced they were in terms of technology and the relative security of iOS compared to Android systems, however the company has been outpaced in recent years as its rivals exceed it - particularly on camera technology.\nReleased on 20 September 2019iPhone 11, from \u00a3729iPhone 11 Pro, from \u00a31,049iPhone 11 Pro Max, from \u00a31,149\nAs a company Huawei has faced sanctions from the White House, ostensibly on security grounds although these were subsequently eased following positive trade deal talks with China, calling into question the initial security grounds for the ban.\nHuawei operates a dual-flagship policy, launching its P-series phones in March for a photography-focused consumer base, and its Mate-series phones in October for consumers who enjoy having the latest technological innovations.\nThe P-series of phones focuses on creativity, aiming for smartphone users who are active on image-heavy social media platforms such as Instagram. The P30 Pro is one of the best on the market for capturing stills, but reviewers considered it merely excellent for video recording.\nThe zoom on the phone offers very high image quality, especially when photographing small objects such as insects - a popular pastime in East Asia.\nInstead of the regular Red Green Blue (RGB) sensor used in most smartphone camera, the Huawei P30 Pro arrived with a Red Yellow Blue (RYB) sensor, allowing the phone a night mode feature which far outperformed that of its rivals.\nThe camera set-up in the P30 Pro was by far the best in the market when it was released, featuring a 5x optical zoom using its periscope technology inside the hardware of the phone itself, and a 50x zoom in aggregate when combined with digital zooming techniques.\nReleased on 26 March 2019P30, from \u00a3429P30 Pro, from \u00a3799P30 Lite, from \u00a3183\nThe triple camera set-up on the phone's rear - rising to a quadruple camera set-up with the S20+ and S20 Ultra - offers users fairly high quality video recording, up to 8K in quality, while in-camera apps and features will also contribute to making it easier for users to produce new content.\nImagery is what the Galaxy S20 range is really focused on, with a larger sensor than on any of Samsung's previous phones alongside the company's nona-binning technology (presumably \"nona\" meaning nine, and \"binning\" referring to the pixel merging technique) combining nine pixels into one at the sensor level.\nThe features and apps are where the S20 range is really targeting its market. In particular, Single Take offers users access to the Galaxy S20's AI in order to curate moments captured in video - similar to GoPro's QuikStories feature.\nSingle Take uses all of the cameras on the rear of the device and simply records the user's actions for up to 10 seconds, before presenting the device user with a selection of content.\nThe S20 Ultra is particularly kitted out for video recording, with an even more powerful wide-angle lens capable of capturing 108MP images with an F1.8 aperture.

the smaller and larger versions of the flagship handset.\nAccording to Bloomberg News these devices will have flat stainless steel edges and sharply rounded corners like the iPad Pro rather than the curves on the current models.\nThe plans are for both of the phones to have slightly larger screens than their predecessors, and for the Face ID notch - which has been mocked by rivals such as Samsung - to be reduced in size.\nThe other devices are expected to be joined by lower-end models, a market segment which Apple doesn't currently have any products in.\nApple had warned investors it would not meet its financial targets due to the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on production and sales in China.\nSky News reported in January that Apple's request to suppliers to produce 80 million iPhones over the first half of 2020 could be delayed due to the coronavirus outbreak.\nAccording to Bloomberg, while some of the new iPhones could be released weeks later than normal, they are still expected to be out during the autumn.\nIt added that suppliers have not been informed of any significant delays and Apple's engineers are expected to travel to China in May to finalise product designs.\nIn addition to the new flagship devices, Apple will be releasing a new, smaller, HomePod speaker, at a lower price to compete with smart speakers sold by Amazon and Google - which have outsold it.\nApple has not responded to a request for comment.","95":"A share price set for state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco will make its flotation the biggest in history and see Apple toppled as the world's most valuable listed firm.\nHowever, it still falls well short of the staggering $2trn (\u00a31.5trn) price tag for the firm sought by the Gulf state's Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman.\nAramco has priced its initial public offering (IPO) at $8.53 (\u00a36.48) a share, the top of its range, it has been confirmed.\nThis will raise $25.6bn (\u00a319.5bn), beating Alibaba's record $25bn (\u00a319.5bn) listing in 2014.\nIt gives the company a market valuation of $1.7trn (\u00a31.3trn), far outstripping that of the US tech giant Apple, put at $1trn (\u00a30.8trn).\nHowever, the listing, expected later this month on the Riyadh stock exchange, is well below the mammoth market debut aimed for.\nSaudi Arabia relied on domestic and regional investors to sell a 1.5% stake after lacklustre interest from overseas investors, despite the reduced valuation.\nIt is also reported that Aramco may also exercise an option, allowing it to increase the size of the deal to a maximum of $29.4bn (\u00a322.3bn).\nThe sale comes as the Saudi government moves to diversify from its reliance on oil to seek revenues from other channels, including tourism.\nMonica Malik, chief economist at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, said: \"The amount raised by the IPO itself is relatively contained given the size of the economy and medium-term funding requirement of the transformation plan.\n\"Nevertheless, combined with other areas of funding, we believe that there is meaningful capital in place to progress with the investment plans aimed at diversifying the economy.\"\nThe Aramco valuation reflected a number of significant concerns among investors, according to analysts.\nAmong them is the Saudi state's control of the company and the fact the listing is not taking place, initially at least, on a leading foreign stock exchange.\nOthers include worries over climate change and security, highlighted by drone and missile attacks on two Aramco processing sites in September, which were claimed by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in neighbouring Yemen.\nSaudi Arabia also faced global condemnation after the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey.\nThe lack of interest by international institutions led Aramco to scrap roadshows in New York and London and focus instead on marketing a stake to Saudi investors and wealthy Gulf Arab allies.\nThe government had promoted the investment as a patriotic duty, with Saudi banks offering people cheap credit to bid for shares.","96":"This is a weird election in many respects, but none more so than the economic battleground on which it is being fought.\nFor the past few decades there has been a clear economic identity associated with each of the political parties.\nOn the one extreme you've had the Tories, pledging to bear down on the public finances with fiscal rules that pledged to cut the national debt and ensure that by the middle of the next decade tax receipts would fully fund the public sector.\nOn the other extreme you've had the Labour party pledging to spend and invest billions more.\nThe Liberal Democrats were always somewhere in the middle.\nBut ever since Boris Johnson became Prime Minister and Sajid Javid Chancellor, that landscape has been thrown into confusion.\nThe new Chancellor has ditched those old, ambitious (some would say too ambitious) fiscal rules and replaced them with ones which allow him to borrow far more.\nIn a rather unusual turn-up for the books, one of his fiscal rules is actually almost identical to Labour's respective rule.\nAnd now into this slightly confusing landscape strides Sir Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat deputy leader, claiming to have stolen the Conservative mantle of being the \"only party of sound finance.\"\nIn a speech a few days ago Sir Ed said: \"Just look at the contrast with the other two parties.\n\"The spending competition between the Brexit parties, the Labour and Conservative fantasists, has made Santa Claus seem like Scrooge.\n\"So while the Conservatives may attack Labour on spending - the truth is both the old parties are now fiscally incontinent.\"\nIs Sir Ed right? Do the Lib Dems really have the tightest fiscal plans of all? Are the other parties now fiscally incontinent?\nFor the answer you need to consider the new fiscal rules each party has put in place.\nBefore we get into the nitty-gritty, let's get one important thing out of the way.\nAll three of these UK parties are planning to spend much more on investment.\nThe Tories have thrown out their rule aiming for an overall budget balance by the middle of the next decade.\nInstead they want to achieve a balanced current budget.\nThe two things might sound similar, but there's a crucial difference: the current budget excludes investment and covers only day-to-day costs.\nNone of the major parties are proposing anything as stringent as the old Conservative rule: all of their plans imply that the government will carry on borrowing, will carry on recording deficits for the foreseeable future.\nThey'll do this by simply excluding investment spending from their main rules.\nWhoever wins, austerity as we knew it really does seem to have come to an end.\nSince we're talking about public investment, it's worth asking whether the Liberal Democrats are the \"sound money\" party on this front. And the answer is: not really.\nIn his speech, Sir Ed signalled that his party would borrow and invest an extra \u00a3130bn to spend on infrastructure and their green investment plans over the next Parliament.\nThat actually works out at more than the Tories, whose new investment rule implies perhaps \u00a3100bn or so of extra investment. Labour, as you've probably guessed, plan to spend even more on investment.\nHow about the current budget, in other words the rules on day-to-day spending?\nHere, the Lib Dem rules look, on the face of it, very tough indeed.\nThey've adopted a recommendation from the Resolution Foundation to target a 1% current surplus.\nThat's in stark contrast to both the Tories and Labour - hence Sir Ed's claim that the other parties have given up on sound finance.\nBut there is an important bit of small print Sir Ed has forgotten to mention.\nThat Resolution Foundation rule allows for a large amount of flexibility.\nIf there's a recession or a significant slowdown, the government would be allowed to run a current deficit (in other words to borrow to finance day-to-day spending) of 1% of GDP.\nThis, it turns out, would be even more fiscally loose than either the Labour or Tory plans.\nSo while the Lib Dem rules might talk a little tougher than the Tory ones, in the event of a recession (and let's not forget we're probably overdue one of those) they would be considerably looser.\nStill, there's a good argument to say that that's precisely the way governments should behave.\nInterest rates are down at around zero.\nIf there is another crunch there will be even more onus than usual on the government to step in and support the economy.\nSo the Lib Dem rules look pretty sensible on this front.\nBut implying that they are tougher than the Tory or indeed Labour ones is going a bit far.\nInstead they look, as ever, to be somewhere in the middle.\nThe main takeaway? All the parties have loosened their fiscal rules considerably and the era of tight public finances is about to give way to, well, the opposite.\nCampaign Check scrutinises election claims made by political parties, examining if they are true or false, and the context.

one of Deloitte, EY, KPMG or PricewaterhouseCoopers - is appointed, work equating to a substantial minority of the audit fee would then have to be undertaken by a smaller rival.\nOne City figure said that substantial minority could be around a third of the audit work.\nThe principal auditor would, however, retain responsibility for signing off the group accounts.\nSources said the FRC's plans would also give it - or its successor, the Audit, Reporting and Governance Authority (ARGA) - the power to intervene in any audit tender process and to ensure that the challenger firm was subsequently being allocated a sufficient degree of a company's audit work.\nThe FRC hopes the template will enable challenger firms - the likes of BDO, Mazars and Grant Thornton - to accelerate their transformation into credible contenders for the largest audit mandates.\nCity sources said the regulator's latest proposals constituted its formal response to the Competition and Markets Authority's recommendations last year, with the centrepiece being a more draconian \"mandatory joint audit\" requirement.\nThat idea, devised with the endorsement of Lord Tyrie, the CMA chairman, is now widely regarded as having been discarded by ministers.\nIt was rejected outright by the accounting profession and blue-chip companies alike as being unworkable, since it would have handed collective oversight of their books to different auditors and necessitated the sign-off of both.\nOne senior corporate figure described the FRC's new idea as \"a sensible compromise that included the right degree of reform without causing chaos in boardrooms\".\nThe fact that the latest proposal originated directly from the watchdog made it likely that it would be adopted by the government, according to one FTSE-100 finance chief.\nThe FRC is considering whether to grant an exemption to the new rules to the very largest multinationals in the FTSE-100 because of their size and complexity - in line with the CMA's proposal last year.\nSky News revealed in November that the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) was exploring some form of shared - rather than joint - audit arrangements.\nThe drive for reform of the audit sector has been the focus of fierce debate since the collapses of BHS in 2016 and Carillion two years later, both of which were partly blamed on defective audit work.\nLast autumn's insolvency of Thomas Cook Group, which triggered thousands of redundancies and left creditors with billions of pounds of losses, has fuelled the desire for urgent reform.\nThe FRC's new top team of chairman Simon Dingemans, GlaxoSmithKline's former finance chief, and chief executive Sir Jon Thompson, who ran HM Revenue & Customs, have held talks about their new blueprint with Whitehall officials and big companies since the turn of the year.\nAmong the major companies expected to tender their audit work in the next couple of years are International Airlines Group, British Airways' parent, and Prudential and Pearson, the education group.\nFTSE-350 companies are in the process of negotiating substantial increases to the audit fees they pay, as reform of the big four and increased scrutiny of audit work leads to higher costs for the profession.\nAn overhaul of the way major quoted businesses are audited is far from the only significant item on the FRC's agenda.\nThe regulator is discussing an 18-point plan for \"operational separation\" with the big four which would avoid a full legal break-up of the firms.\nThat plan would entail separate boards, remuneration and governance arrangements for the quartet's audit and consulting arms.\nA wider package of measures was recommended in separate reports by Sir John Kingman, the former Treasury mandarin, and the City grandee Sir Donald Brydon last year.\nSir John has been critical of the government's hitherto vague commitment to introducing the legislation necessary to abolish the FRC and replace it with the more robust ARGA.\nThe existing watchdog has tried to show its teeth under pressure by levying a stream of multimillion-pound fines in the last two years - many of them against KPMG for its audit work on companies including Ted Baker and the Co-operative Bank.\nIn an interview with the Financial Times this week, Mr Dingemans said there was a debate under way about whether to bring large privately owned companies within the scope of its regulatory regime.\nThe FRC declined to comment on Saturday.","99":"Police searching for a woman missing in the Australian outback for more than two weeks have found a body.\nFormal identification is yet to be made, but officers believe the body to be that Claire Hockridge.\nThe 46-year-old had been travelling with two others when their car got stuck in a riverbed on 19 November. They split up to find help.\nTamra McBeath-Riley, 52, and Phu Tran, 40, were found alive earlier this week.\nMr Tran was discovered on Tuesday by a farmer in a remote area south of Alice Springs, Northern Territory police confirmed.\nTamra McBeath-Riley was found on Sunday.\nAccording to ABC News, the group stayed by the car for three days - relying on a supply of six litres of water, 10 cans of iced vodka, a packet of biscuits and some beef noodles.\nWith temperatures reaching up to 40C (104F), they dug a hole underneath the car in an attempt to stay cool during the day - and slept in the car at night.\nWhen supplies ran out, they made the difficult decision to move on.\nThey left a note on the car and found a watering hole about a mile away. Ms McBeath-Riley decided to stay There with her Staffordshire terrier, fearful that the dog wouldn't survive a longer trek.\nHer two friends began a 12-mile trek towards a highway, armed with a GPS device and a compass.\nThe pair had planned to avoid the desert heat by walking at night. Although they were carrying six litres of water to stay hydrated, they had little in the way of food."}}
